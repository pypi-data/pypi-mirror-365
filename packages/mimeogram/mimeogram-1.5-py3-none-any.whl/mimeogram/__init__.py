''' Exchange of file collections with LLMs.

    A toolkit for exchanging collections of files with Large Language Models
    (LLMs). Mimeogram bundles multiple files into a single clipboard-ready
    document while preserving directory structure and metadata, making it ideal
    for code reviews, project sharing, and LLM interactions.
