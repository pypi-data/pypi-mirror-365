## 2. Agreement

When you use our Products, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce a right or provision of the Terms; however, that does not mean we are waiving that right or provision.

Upon payment and agreement of these Terms by you, the Company grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use the Products for your personal or business purposes.

These Terms do contain a limitation of our liability.

If you violate any of the Terms, we may terminate your account, without notice and without compensation.

## 3. Account, Ownership and Legal Responsibility

By default, a Phoneshift account is owned by an individual, not by an organization. When you sign up and create a Phoneshift account, you are the owner of that account.

By default, our legal responsibility is to the account owner, so we won't let other people take over your account without your permission.

However, if you own an account for the sole purpose of a work of an organisation (a company, a society, an association, a fondation, etc.), our legal responsibility is to the organisation. Upon reception of the necessary document provided by your organisation, we might transfer your account without your permission.

Please create a separate account for each legal entity you work with.

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password and for ensuring that any of your users do the same. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

### 3.1 Start and end dates

The Start date is the date when you first used any of the Products.

The End date is the date when your license has been cancelled (no matter how it has been cancelled).

### 3.2 Suspension, Cancellation and Deletion

Suspension means you and any other linked users will not be able to use any Product. You might re-enable your subscription within 6 months. Past this delay, and if you do not re-enable your subscription within this period, your Account will be scheduled for cancellation.

Besides this automatic cancellation due to inactivity, you are responsible for properly cancelling your account.

If you need help cancelling your account, you can always reach us at <support@phoneshift.ing>

If you only cancel your payment method before the end of your current paid up period, you will not be charged again and the Products will become unusable at the end of your current paid up period. Then starts the 6 months delay that allows you to re-enable your subscription or scheduling for cancellation.

However, if you cancel your account before the end of your current paid up period, the Products will be suspended **immediatly**. We do not automatically prorate unused time in the last billing period.

After cancellation (no matter how it was canceled), within 60 days, all data we might own will be permanently deleted from our active systems logs and backups. We cannot recover this information once it has been permanently deleted.

There are three exceptions to the retention periods described above:

* Tax and other administrative laws might force us to keep some data for up to 18 months. We will always do our best to delete this type of information as soon as possible as it has absolutely no value for us.

* Data that has any value for handling any dispute or litigation might be held as long as necessary (see Sec. 8.5).

* Fully anonimyzed information (see Sec. 8.4).

### 3.3 Termination

We have the right to cancel and delete your account and refuse any and all current or future use of our Products for any reason at any time.

We also reserve the right to refuse the use of the Products to anyone for any reason at any time. 

We have this clause because statistically speaking, out of thousands accounts, there is at least one doing something malicious, malignant or nefarious. There are some things we staunchly stand against and this clause is how we exercise that stance. For more details, please see Sec. 10.

We reserve right to not serve users whose connections go from or through countries that do not respect fundamental Human Rights, as per International Conventions and Treaties.

Upon termination, you must immediately cease using our Products.

## 4. Billing and payments

Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record. We may also post a notice about changes on our websites.

Due to the nature of the product, the Company does not offer refunds. If you truly believe you are owed a refund, you can contact us at <support@phoneshift.ing>

At the end of any free trial period you may be using, either of the two will happen:

* The account will be charged according to the user's chosen subscription.

* The account will be suspended until upgraded to a paid version.

All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing authorities. Otherwise, you are responsible for payment of all taxes, levies, or duties.

When using our Products, you must ensure that the Users associated to your account comply with all applicable laws and regulations and respect the Terms of this License.

You are prohibited from using our Products for any unlawful, harmful, or infringing purposes.

We do our darnedest to be as safe a bet as possible through careful management of our business; investments in security, infrastructure, and talent; and in general taking care. If you choose to use our Products, thank you for betting on us.

## 7. Warranties

We provide no warranties of any sort.

You use our Products at your sole risk. We provide these Products on an "as is" and "as available" basis. 

You are solely responsible for your use of our Products and any applications built using them.

We make no guarantees that our Products will meet your specific requirements or expectations.

We test our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our Products inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don't guarantee completely error-free Products.

### 7.1 Service Level Agreement (SLA)

We do not offer Service-Level Agreements (SLA), but do take uptime of our Services very seriously. 
Visit our Status Page (https://status.phoneshift.ing) to see the status of our Products.
There is currently no warranty of a threshold of SLA.

Nevertheless, for any day that has shown any significant down time, we will do our best to offer proportional compensation to any customer impacted by the down time.
The Status Page serves as the ground truth to assess down times.
We obviously keep the right of the interpretation of "significant", "proportional" and "impacted".

We believe a high service level, as demonstrated by the Status Page, and a fair compensation mechanism should be more convincing enough.

No hash technics are used to make them pseudo-anonymized.
