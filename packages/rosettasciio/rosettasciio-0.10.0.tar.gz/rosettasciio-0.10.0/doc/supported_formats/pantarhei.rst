CEOS Panta Rhei (PRZ)
---------------------

RosettaSciIO can read and write ``.prz`` files used by the CEOS Panta Rhei software.
The ``.prz`` files are based on open formats (numpy arrays and python dictionaries)
so a complete support is in principle possible.
However, as new features are continuously being added to Panta Rhei, it is also
possible to occasionally encounter some which are not yet supported by RosettaSciIO.
Please report any problematic file on the `issues tracker 
<https://github.com/hyperspy/rosettasciio/issues>`_ to make us aware of it.
