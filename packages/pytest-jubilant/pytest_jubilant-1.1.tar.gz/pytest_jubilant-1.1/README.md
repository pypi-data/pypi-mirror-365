# Pytest plugin for jubilant.

Eases the transition from pytest-operator to jubilant.
And some cool stuff on top.

# Fixtures

## `juju` 
This is a module(and model!)-scoped fixture that, by default, uses a temporary model and tears it down on context exit.
Cfr. the `--model`, `--keep-models`, and `--no-teardown` options below for more.
Usage:

```python
from jubilant import Juju, all_active

def test_deploy(juju: Juju):
    juju.deploy("./foo.charm", "foo")
    juju.wait(
        lambda status: all_active(status, "foo"),
        timeout=1000
    )
```

## `temp_model_factory`
This is a module-scoped fixture that manages temporary models for your test runs. 
It is what the `juju` fixture is using behind the scenes. 

Especially useful if you have test cases that require multiple models.
```python
import pytest
from jubilant import Juju, all_active

@pytest.fixture
def istio(temp_model_factory):
    yield temp_model_factory.get_juju(suffix="istio")
    
    
def test_cmr(juju: Juju, istio: Juju):
    istio.deploy("istio-k8s", "istio")
    istio.wait(
        lambda status: all_active(status, "istio"),
        timeout=1000
    )

    juju.deploy("./foo.charm", "foo")
    juju.wait(
        lambda status: all_active(status, "foo"),
        timeout=1000
    )

    juju.cli("offer", "foo:bar") 
    istio.cli("consume", f"{juju.model}:foo")
    istio.cli("relate", "istio", "foo:bar")
```

This test will spin up two temporary models, one called `test-cmr-<randomhex>`, and one called `test-cmr-<randomhex>istio`, 
and tear them down on context exit.

This fixture can be used with the options described below:
- `pytest tests/test_cmr.py --keep-models` will skip model teardown for all generated models.
- `pytest tests/test_cmr.py --model test-cmr-<randomhex>` will use `test-cmr-<randomhex>` as base name, and the suffixes you defined in the fixtures will give all generated models predictable names, which means that the tests will reuse the existing models (if found) or create new ones with those names.
- `pytest tests/test_cmr.py --switch` will switch you to the 'base' model `test-cmr-<randomhex>` (not to one of the suffixed ones!).


# Pytest CLI options

## `--model`
Override the default model name generation (test module + random bits) and use a fixed model name instead.
Do note that this model **will** be torn down at the end of the test run just like any other, so if you're targeting an existing model you care about, don't forget the `--no-teardown` flag!.

Usage:

    pytest ./tests/integration -k test_foo --model "model2" 
    # runs the tests on a new 'model2' model and tears it down afterwards

    juju add-model model1
    pytest ./tests/integration -k test_foo --model "model1" --no-teardown 
    # runs the tests on the existing 'model1' model, and keeps it
    

## `--switch`
Switch to the (randomly-named?) model that is currently in scope, so you can keep an 
eye on the juju status as the tests progress. 
(Won't work well if you're running multiple test modules in parallel.)

Usage:

    pytest ./tests/integration -k test-something --switch  
    # will switch you to the test-something-09i123451 (random bits may differ) model as soon as it's created 

    pytest ./tests/integration -k test-something --model mymodel --switch  
    # will switch you to the `mymodel` model as soon as it's created 

## `--keep-models`
Skip destroying the newly generated models when the tests are done. 
Usage:

    pytest ./tests/integration --keep-models  


## `--no-teardown`
Skip all tests marked with `teardown` (**and skip destroying the models**! this flag implies the `--keep-models` one).
Useful to inspect the state of a model after a (failed) test run.

Usage:
    pytest ./tests/integration --no-teardown 


## `--no-setup`
Skip all tests marked with `setup`. Especially useful when re-running a test on an existing model which is already set-up, but not torn down.
See [this article](https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/14006) for the idea behind this workflow.
Usage:

    pytest ./tests/integration --no-teardown # make a note of the temporary model name
    pytest ./tests/integration --model <temporary model name> --no-setup 


## `--dump-logs`
Prior to tearing down all models owned by a temp_model_factory (i.e. prior to cleaning up a test module execution), dump the `juju debug-log --replay` for each model into a directory (default `"<CWD>/.logs"`). File naming scheme is:

`<module name>-<random bits>[-<suffix>]-jdl.txt`

Usage:

    pytest ./tests/integration ./integration/test_ingress.py --dump-logs=./debug_logs
    # once the tests are done, you'll find the logs in 
    # ./debug_logs/test-ingress-c372ef49-jdl.txt (random bits may vary).

    pytest ./tests/integration ./integration/test_ingress.py --model foo --dump-logs=./debug_logs
    # once the tests are done, you'll find the logs in
    # ./debug_logs/foo-jdl.txt

    pytest ./tests/integration ./integration/test_ingress.py --dump-logs=""
    # no logs will be saved


# Markers

## `setup`

Marker for tests that prepare (parts of) a model.

Usage:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.setup
def test_deploy(juju):
    juju.deploy("A")
    juju.deploy("B")

@pytest.mark.setup
def test_relate(juju):
    juju.integrate("A", "B")
```

## `teardown`
Marker for tests that destroy (parts of) a model. 

Usage:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.teardown
def test_disintegrate(juju):
    juju.remove_relation("A", "B")

@pytest.mark.teardown
def test_destroy(juju):
    juju.remove_application("A")
    juju.remove_application("B")
```

# Utilities

## `pack` and `get_resources`

Wrapper around `charmcraft pack` to build a charm and return the packed charm path, ready to be passed to `juju.deploy`.
`get_resources` will parse a `charmcraft.yaml` file and return a mapping from resources to their `upstream-source` 
field as is standard convention.

```yaml
# example /path/to/foo-charm-repo-root-dir/charmcraft.yaml

# [snip] 
resources:
  nginx-image:
    type: oci-image
    description: OCI image for nginx
    upstream-source: ubuntu/nginx:1.24-24.04_beta
  nginx-prometheus-exporter-image:
    type: oci-image
    description: OCI image for nginx-prometheus-exporter
    upstream-source: nginx/nginx-prometheus-exporter:1.1.0
```

Usage:

```python
from pytest_jubilant import pack, get_resources
import pytest


@pytest.mark.setup
def test_build_deploy_charm(juju):
    charm_root = "/path/to/foo-charm-repo-root-dir/"
    juju.deploy(
        pack(charm_root),
        "foo",
        # the resources can only be inferred from the charm's metadata/charmcraft yaml 
        # if you use the `upstream-source` convention
        resources=get_resources(charm_root),
        num_units=3,
    )
```

If you have a multiplatform charm, you can use: `pack("./", platform="ubuntu@24.04")`.

# DEVELOPERS
