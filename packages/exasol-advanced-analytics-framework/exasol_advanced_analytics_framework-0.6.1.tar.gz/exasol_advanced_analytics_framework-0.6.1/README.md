# Exasol Advanced Analytics Framework

Framework for building complex data analysis algorithms with Exasol.

This framework allows you to implement advanced analytics algorithms — like PageRank or K-Means — that run iteratively inside the Exasol database. It bridges the gap between Python (for data science logic) and Lua (for database-side execution control), enabling complex workflows to be run within a single transaction context.
