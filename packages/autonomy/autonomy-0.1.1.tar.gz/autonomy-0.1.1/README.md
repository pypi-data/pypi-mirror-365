**Open source platform enabling humans + AI to collaborate for knowledge work** ‚Äì An intelligent GitHub planning system with configurable AI agents that learn from your team's patterns and coordinate tasks across humans and specialized AI assistants.

---

## üéØ Vision

Autonomy transforms GitHub into an intelligent collaboration platform where AI agents work alongside human team members to plan, prioritize, and coordinate work. The platform supports configurable AI agents - from core planning agents to specialized domain experts - all configurable through simple YAML files. Instead of replacing human judgment, it augments team decision-making with memory-driven insights and automated task coordination.
