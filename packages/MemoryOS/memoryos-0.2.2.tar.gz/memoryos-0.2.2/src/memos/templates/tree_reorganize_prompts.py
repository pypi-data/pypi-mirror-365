REORGANIZE_PROMPT = """You are a memory clustering and summarization expert.

Given the following child memory items:

{memory_items_text}

Please perform:
1. Identify information that reflects user's experiences, beliefs, concerns, decisions, plans, or reactions — including meaningful input from assistant that user acknowledged or responded to.
2. Resolve all time, person, and event references clearly:
   - Convert relative time expressions (e.g., “yesterday,” “next Friday”) into absolute dates using the message timestamp if possible.
   - Clearly distinguish between event time and message time.
   - If uncertainty exists, state it explicitly (e.g., “around June 2025,” “exact date unclear”).
   - Include specific locations if mentioned.
   - Resolve all pronouns, aliases, and ambiguous references into full names or identities.
   - Disambiguate people with the same name if applicable.
3. Always write from a third-person perspective, referring to user as
"The user" or by name if name mentioned, rather than using first-person ("I", "me", "my").
For example, write "The user felt exhausted..." instead of "I felt exhausted...".
4. Do not omit any information that user is likely to remember.
   - Include all key experiences, thoughts, emotional responses, and plans — even if they seem minor.
   - Prioritize completeness and fidelity over conciseness.
   - Do not generalize or skip details that could be personally meaningful to user.
5. Summarize all child memory items into one memory item.

Language rules:
- The `key`, `value`, `tags`, `summary` fields must match the mostly used language of the input memory items.  **如果输入是中文，请输出中文**
- Keep `memory_type` in English.

LOCAL_SUBCLUSTER_PROMPT = """You are a memory organization expert.

You are given a cluster of memory items, each with an ID and content.
Your task is to divide these into smaller, semantically meaningful sub-clusters.

Instructions:
- Identify natural topics by analyzing common time, place, people, and event elements.
- Each sub-cluster must reflect a coherent theme that helps retrieval.
- Each sub-cluster should have 2–10 items. Discard singletons.
- Each item ID must appear in exactly one sub-cluster or be discarded. No duplicates are allowed.
- All IDs in the output must be from the provided Memory items.
- Return strictly valid JSON only.

Example: If you have items about a project across multiple phases, group them by milestone, team, or event.

PAIRWISE_RELATION_PROMPT = """
You are a reasoning assistant.

Given two memory units:
- Node 1: "{node1}"
- Node 2: "{node2}"

Your task:
- Determine their relationship ONLY if it reveals NEW usable reasoning or retrieval knowledge that is NOT already explicit in either unit.
- Focus on whether combining them adds new temporal, causal, conditional, or conflict information.

Valid options:
- CAUSE: One clearly leads to the other.
- CONDITION: One happens only if the other condition holds.
- RELATE: They are semantically related by shared people, time, place, or event, but neither causes the other.
- CONFLICT: They logically contradict each other.
- NONE: No clear useful connection.

Example:
- Node 1: "The marketing campaign ended in June."
- Node 2: "Product sales dropped in July."
Answer: CAUSE

Another Example:
- Node 1: "The conference was postponed to August due to the venue being unavailable."
- Node 2: "The venue was booked for a wedding in August."
Answer: CONFLICT

Always respond with ONE word, no matter what language is for the input nodes: [CAUSE | CONDITION | RELATE | CONFLICT | NONE]

You are an inference expert.

Source Memory: "{source}"
Target Memory: "{target}"

They are connected by a {relation_type} relation.
Derive ONE new factual statement that clearly combines them in a way that is NOT a trivial restatement.

Requirements:
- Include relevant time, place, people, and event details if available.
- If the inference is a logical guess, explicitly use phrases like "It can be inferred that...".

Example:
Source: "John missed the team meeting on Monday."
Target: "Important project deadlines were discussed in that meeting."
Relation: CAUSE
Inference: "It can be inferred that John may not know the new project deadlines."

Your task:

- Do NOT aggregate if the overlap is trivial or obvious from each unit alone.
- If the summary involves any plausible interpretation, explicitly note it (e.g., "This suggests...").

Example:

- "Mary organized the 2023 sustainability summit in Berlin."
- "Mary presented a keynote on renewable energy at the same summit."
