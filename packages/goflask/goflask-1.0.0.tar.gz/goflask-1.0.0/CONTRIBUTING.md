## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct based on respect, inclusivity, and collaboration. By participating, you agree to uphold these values:

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Help maintain a positive community environment
- Report any unacceptable behavior to the maintainers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Go 1.21 or higher (for core development)
- Git for version control
- Basic understanding of Flask and Go

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the GoFlask repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/goflask.git
   cd goflask
   ```

3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/goflask/goflask.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Python Environment

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

### Go Environment

1. Ensure Go is installed and configured
2. Install Go dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd go-backend
   go mod download
   ```

3. Build the Go shared library:
   ```bash
   go build -buildmode=c-shared -o goflask.dll goflask_c_api.go
   ```

### Verification

Run the test suite to verify your setup:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

## Making Changes

### Branching Strategy

1. Create a feature branch from main:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes in logical commits
3. Keep commits small and focused
4. Write clear commit messages

5. Add performance benchmarks for new features

### Test Structure
```python
def test_feature_description():
    """Test that feature works as expected"""
    # Arrange
    app = GoFlask(__name__)
    
    # Act
    result = app.some_method()
    
    # Assert
    assert result == expected_value
```

## Code Style

### Python Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for public functions
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep line length under 88 characters

```python
def create_response(data: Dict[str, Any], status_code: int = 200) -> GoFlaskResponse:
    """
    Create a GoFlask response object.
    
    Args:
        data: Response data to serialize
        status_code: HTTP status code
        
    Returns:
        GoFlaskResponse object
    """
    return GoFlaskResponse(data, status_code)
```

### Go Code Style

- Follow Go standard formatting (use `gofmt`)
- Use meaningful function and variable names
- Add comments for exported functions
- Handle errors appropriately
- Follow Go best practices

```go
// CreateApp creates a new GoFlask application instance
func CreateApp(name string) *App {
    app := fiber.New(fiber.Config{
        ErrorHandler: defaultErrorHandler,
    })
    return &App{
        fiber: app,
        name:  name,
    }
}
```

### Formatting Tools

- Python: Use `black` and `isort` for formatting
- Go: Use `gofmt` and `goimports`
- Run formatters before committing:

```bash
# Python formatting
black goflask/
isort goflask/

# Go formatting
gofmt -w go-backend/
goimports -w go-backend/
```

## Documentation

### Documentation Standards

1. Write clear, concise documentation
2. Include code examples
3. Update README.md for significant changes
4. Add docstrings to new functions
5. Update API documentation

### Example Documentation

```python
def enable_cors(self, origins: List[str] = None, methods: List[str] = None) -> None:
    """
    Enable CORS middleware for cross-origin requests.
    
    This method configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow
    web applications running at different domains to access this API.
    
    Args:
        origins: List of allowed origins. Defaults to ['*'] (all origins).
        methods: List of allowed HTTP methods. Defaults to all standard methods.
        
    Example:
        >>> app = GoFlask(__name__)
        >>> app.enable_cors(origins=['https://myapp.com'], methods=['GET', 'POST'])
        
    Note:
        For production use, specify explicit origins instead of using '*'.
    """
```

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Guidelines

1. Measure performance impact of changes
2. Use benchmarks for performance-critical code
3. Consider memory usage implications
4. Optimize for common use cases
5. Document performance characteristics

### Benchmarking

```python
import time
from goflask import GoFlask

def benchmark_request_handling():
    """Benchmark request handling performance"""
    app = GoFlask(__name__)
    
    @app.route('/test')
    def test_endpoint():
        return {'message': 'test'}
    
    start_time = time.time()
    # Simulate requests
    for _ in range(1000):
        # Measure request handling
        pass
    end_time = time.time()
    
    print(f"Handled 1000 requests in {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
```

### Performance Targets

- Maintain 5x performance advantage over Flask
- Keep memory usage within 30% of Flask baseline
- Response times under 10ms for simple endpoints
- Support 1000+ concurrent connections

## Release Process
