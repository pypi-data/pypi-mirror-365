# Overview


`notaryjerk` started as a replacement for Apple's `notarytool`
(which requires *XCode*>=13.x), by using the Apple's API directly.

It is now intended as a general toolset that helps with creating and
distributing signed binary packages, that is usable on any platform
supporting Python (not necessarily the target platform of the codesigned
binaries. E.g. you can notarize macOS binaries under Linux).

AFAIK, this is currently the only tool, that allows (somewhat easy)
notarization of macOS binaries on platforms other than macOS.


As of now, only macOS binaries are supported.

## Installation

```sh
pip install notaryjerk
```
