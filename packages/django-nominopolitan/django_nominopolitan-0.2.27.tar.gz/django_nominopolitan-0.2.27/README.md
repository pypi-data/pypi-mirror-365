# Django Nominopolitan

**An opinionated extension for neapolitan that adds the advanced CRUD features you usually have to build yourself.**

## What is Nominopolitan?

The [`neapolitan`](https://github.com/carltongibson/neapolitan/) package gives you a solid foundation for Django CRUD views. But you still need to add filtering, bulk operations, modern UX features, and styling yourself.

Nominopolitan comes with these features built-in, specifically for user-facing CRUD interfaces. Use what you need, customize what you want.

!!! warning "Early Alpha Release"
    This is a **very early alpha** release with limited tests and documentation. Expect breaking changes. You might prefer to fork or copy what you need.

## Key Features

🎯 **Advanced CRUD Operations** - Filtering, bulk edit/delete, and pagination out of the box  
⚡ **Modern Web UX** - HTMX integration, modals, and reactive updates  
🎨 **Multiple CSS Frameworks** - daisyUI/Tailwind (default) and Bootstrap 5 support  
🔧 **Developer Friendly** - Convention over configuration with full customization options  

## Quick Example

Start with basic neapolitan:

```python
# Basic neapolitan
class ProjectView(CRUDView):
    model = Project
```

Add Nominopolitan for advanced features:

```python
# With Nominopolitan
class ProjectView(NominopolitanMixin, CRUDView):
    model = Project
    fields = ["name", "owner", "status"]
    base_template_path = "core/base.html"
    
    # Modern features
    use_htmx = True
    use_modal = True
    
    # Advanced filtering
    filterset_fields = ["owner", "status", "created_date"]
    
    # Bulk operations
    bulk_fields = ["status", "owner"]
    bulk_delete = True
    
    # Enhanced display
    properties = ["is_overdue", "days_remaining"]
```
