              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Kubernetes Tools

![Unit Tests](https://github.com/BenedatLLC/k8stools/actions/workflows/unit-tests.yml/badge.svg)

This package provides a collection of Kubernetes functions to be used by Agents. They can be passed
directly to an agent as tools or placed behind an MCP server (included). Some use cases include:
* Chat with your kubernetes cluster via GitHub CoPilot or Cursor.
* Build [agents](https://github.com/BenedatLLC/orca-agent/) to monitor your cluster or perform root cause analysis.
* Vibe-code a custom chat UI.
* Use in non-agentic automations.

Here's an example, click to see video:

[![Demo of a live chat](chat-with-cluster.png)](https://youtu.be/huN20MlHPiA)

## Methodology

Our goal is to focus on quality over quantity -- providing
well-documented and strongly typed tools. We believe that this is a critical in enabling
agents to make effective use of tools, beyond simple demos.

These are built on top of the kubernetes Python API (https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python).
There are three styles of tools provided here:
1. There are tools that mimic the output of kubectl commands (e.g. `get_pod_summaries`, which is equivalent
   to `kubectl get pods`).  Strongly-typed Pydantic models are used for the return values of these tools.
2. There are tools that return strongly typed Pydantic models that attempt to match the associated Kubernetes
   client types (see https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/tree/master/kubernetes/docs).
   Lesser used fields may be omitted from these models. An example of this case is `get_pod_container_statuses`.
3. In some cases we simply call `to_dict()` on the class returned by the API (defined in 
   https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/tree/master/kubernetes/client/models).
   The return type is `dict[str,Any]`, but we document the fields in the function's docstring.
   `get_pod_spec` is an example of this type of tool.

Currently, the priority is on functions that do not modify the state of the cluster.
We want to focus first on the monitoring / RCA use cases. When we do add tools to address
other use cases, they will be kept separate from the read-only tools so you can still build
"safe" agents.

## Installation
Via `pip`:

```sh
pip install k8stools
```

Via `uv`:
```sh
uv add k8stools
```

## Current tools

These are the tools we define:

* `get_namespaces` - get a list of namespaces, like `kubectl get namespace`
* `get_node_summaries` - get a list of nodes, like `kubectl get nodes -o wide`
* `get_pod_summaries` - get a list of pods, like `kubectl get pods -o wide`
* `get_pod_container_statuses` - return the status for each of the container in a pod
* `get_pod_events` - return the events for a pod
* `get_pod_spec` - retrieves the spec for a given pod
* `get_logs_for_pod_and_container` - retrieves logs from a pod and container
* `get_deployment_summaries` - get a list of deployments, like `kubectl get deployments`
* `get_service_summaries` - get a list of services, like `kubectl get services`

We also define a set of associated "print_" functions that are helpful in debugging:

* `print_namespaces`
* `print_node_summaries`
* `print_pod_summaries`
* `print_pod_container_statuses`
* `print_pod_events`
* `print_pod_spec`
* `print_deployment_summaries`
* `print_service_summaries`

## Using the tools
### Directly use in an agent
The core tools are in `k8stools.k8s_tools`. Here's an example usage in an agent:

```python
from pydantic_ai.agent import Agent
from k8stools.k8s_tools import TOOLS

agent = Agent(
        model="openai:gpt-4.1",
        system_prompt=SYSTEM_PROMPT,
        tools=TOOLS
)

result = agent.run_sync("What is the status of the pods in my cluster?")
print(result.output)
```

### Using via MCP
The script `k8s-mcp-server` provides an MCP server for the same set of tools.
Here are the command line arguments for the server:
```
usage: k8s-mcp-server [-h] [--transport {streamable-http,stdio}] [--host HOST] [--port PORT]
                      [--log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}] [--debug]

Run the MCP server.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --transport {streamable-http,stdio}
                        Transport to use for MCP server [default: stdio]
  --host HOST           Hostname for HTTP service [default: 127.0.0.1]
  --port PORT           Port for HTTP service [default: 8000]
  --log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}
                        Log level [default: INFO]
  --debug               Enable debug mode [default: False]
```

#### Use MCP with the stdio transport
The *stdio* transport is best for use with local Coding Agents, like GitHub CoPilot or Cursor.
It is the default, so you can run the `k8s-mcp-server` script without arguments. Here's an example
`mcp.json` configuration:

```json
{
   "servers": {
      "k8stools-stdio": {
         "command": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/k8s-mcp-server",
         "args": [
         ],
         "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.envrc"
      }
   }
}
```

This assumes the following:
1. The Python virtual environment is expected to be in `.venv` under the root of your VSCode workspace
2. You have installed the k8stools package into your workspace
3. The environment file `.envrc` contains any variables you need defined. In particular, you may need to
   set `KUBECONFIG` to point to your `kubectl` config file.

#### Use MCP with the streamable HTTP transport
The *streamable http* transport is enabled with the command line option `--transport=streamable-http`. It will
start an HTTP server which listens on the specified address and port (defaulting to 127.0.0.1 and 8000, respectively).
This transport is best for cases where you want remote access to your MCP server.

Here's a short example that starts the server and then does a sanity test using `curl` to get the tool information:
```sh
# start the server
 $ k8s-mcp-server --transport=streamable-http
[07/21/25 19:55:13] INFO     Starting with 6 tools on transport streamable-http           mcp_server.py:59
INFO:     Started server process [6649]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO     StreamableHTTP session manager started         streamable_http_manager.py:111
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)

# Now, open another terminal window and test it
$ curl -v \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
     -d '{
           "jsonrpc": "2.0",
           "id": 1,
           "method": "tools/list",
           "params": {}
         }' \

```

## Mock tools
When building agents, it can be helpful to test them against *mock* versions that do
not go against a real cluster, but return static (but realistic) values. The module
`k8stools.mock_tools` does just that. The data values were captured when running
against a real Minikube instance running the
(Open Telemetry Demo)[https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo]
application. When running the MCP server, this may be enabled by using the
`--mock` command line option.

## Instruction files
GitHub CoPilot supports *instruction* files that can provide additional context to the CoPilot
Coding Agent. It can even analyze your project and create one for you. By default, this gets
saved to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. You can manually add instructions to customize
your agent for using your MCP tools. As an example, here's the additional content included
in this repository's `copilot-instructions.md`:

> ### MCP Integration
> Run server: `k8s-mcp-server [--transport stdio|streamable-http]`
> Tools auto-registered via `Tool.from_function()` in `mcp_server.py`
> 
> When answering questions about the user's kubernetes cluster, use the
> tools provided by this server, which is configured in `mcp.json` as
> `k8stools-stdio`. Some other considerations when answering these
> questions:
> * If the answer includes multiple, similar entries, format as a table
>   if possible.
> * When providing pod statuses, be sure to include the state of the pod.
> * When providing a status, use an icon show quickly show if it is good or bad.
> * If you are asked for the current status, and you haven't run a request in
>   more than an minute, be sure to run the tool again to get the latest status.
