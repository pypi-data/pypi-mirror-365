# Uvy

Uvy is a toolkit for Python monorepos that use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). It aims to provide a set of utilities to enhance the development experience, streamline workflows, and make managing large monorepos easier. In the future, Uvy will offer a variety of commands and features tailored for uv-based monorepos.

## The `list` Command

The `list` command lists and filters packages in the current uv monorepo. It helps you quickly view, organize, and analyze package information, making it easier to manage your project's structure.

**Usage:**

```sh
uvy packages [OPTIONS]
```

**Main options:**

- `-c, --columns <columns>`: Comma-separated list of columns to display (e.g., name, path, version, tags). Can be specified multiple times. Defaults to `name,path,version,tags`.
- `-f, --format <format>`: Output format. Choices: ascii, json, markdown, text, unicode. Defaults to `unicode`.
- `-t, --tags <tags>`: Filter packages by tags. Supports regex patterns. Can be specified multiple times or as a comma-separated list.
- `--with-dependents`: Include packages that the listed packages depend on.
- `--with-dependees`: Include packages that depend on the listed packages.
