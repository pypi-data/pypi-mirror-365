# `Bleak` compatible backend for `Pythonista` iOS app

**This module uses `bleak` backend API to implement a compatible solution for `Pythonista` iOS app. 
It uses Pythonista built-in `_cb` module, that is wrapper to iOS `CoreBluetooth`.**

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is in early `beta` use with caution

* This backend refers to [Pythonista.cb docs](https://omz-software.com/pythonista/docs/ios/cb.html)
* This backend refers to existing [`macOS CoreBluetooth bleak backend`](https://github.com/hbldh/bleak/tree/develop/bleak/backends/corebluetooth) was used as a reference
* It also provides stub files for pythonista built-in modules as `_cb` and `pythonista.cb`, and fake `_cb.py` implementation for testing on unsupported platforms
* Use [`Bleak` docs](https://github.com/hbldh/bleak/blob/develop/README.rst) to explore how to use `Bleak`

## Installation
```Bash
pip install bleak-pythonista
```

## Usage
Direct import
```python
import asyncio
from bleak_pythonista import BleakScanner

async def main():
    devices = await BleakScanner.discover(
        service_uuids=["<some-service-uuid>"]  # optional
    )
    for d in devices:
        print(d)
    
asyncio.run(main())
```

With `bleak` itself
```python
import asyncio
from bleak import BleakScanner
from bleak_pythonista import BleakScannerPythonistaCB

async def main():
    devices = await BleakScanner.discover(
        service_uuids=["<some-service-uuid>"],  # optional
        backend=BleakScannerPythonistaCB,
    )
    for d in devices:
        print(d)
    
asyncio.run(main())
```

> [!WARNING]
> DO NOT NAME YOUR SCRIPT `bleak.py`! It will cause a circular import error.

## What's done?

* CentralManagerDelegate (for now for scanning purpose only)
* scanner.BleakScannerPythonistaCB
* `_cb` and `pythonista.cb` stubs
* fake `cb.py` for testing with backend simulation on unsupported platforms 

## Work in progress

* PeripheralDelegate
* client.BleakClientPythonistaCB
