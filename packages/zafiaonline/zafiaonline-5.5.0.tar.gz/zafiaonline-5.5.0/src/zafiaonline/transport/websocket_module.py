class Config:
    """
    Loads WebSocket server configuration from a YAML file.

    This class reads settings from a YAML file and assigns them to instance attributes.
    If any values are missing, sensible defaults are applied.

    Attributes:
        address (str): Hostname or IP address of the WebSocket server. Defaults to 'dottap.com'.
        port (int): Port number of the WebSocket server. Defaults to 7091.
        connect_type (str): Protocol type, either 'ws' or 'wss'. Defaults to 'wss'.

    Args:
        path (str, optional): Path to the YAML configuration file. Defaults to 'ws_config.yaml'.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the YAML file is not found.
        yaml.YAMLError: If the YAML content is malformed.

    Examples:
        Instantiate and access attributes:

            print(config.address)       # e.g. 'dottap.com'

                1. Checks if the connection is active (`self.alive`).
                2. Sets `self.alive` to `False` to prevent further operations.
                3. Calls `_close_websocket()` to properly close the connection.
                4. Cancels the background listener task (`__listener()`).

                - Detecting if already closed.

        Notes:

                    - If decoding succeeds, returns the resulting dictionary.
                    - If decoding fails, logs the malformed message and continues.
            - If no message is received within 5 seconds, a debug message is logged
              and the loop continues waiting.
            - All exceptions except `KeyboardInterrupt` are caught and logged internally.
            - JSON decoding errors and unexpected values are logged with context.
            - Timeout events are logged at the debug level to reduce noise.
            - Unexpected exceptions are captured and logged without interrupting the loop.
            - This method is designed to run in a persistent listening loop within
              an asynchronous context and will return after handling a single message,
