# CSV Diff

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### Using pip

You can install CSV Diff using pip with the following command:

```bash

### From Source

1. Clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/fityannugroho/csv-diff.git
    cd csv-diff
    ```

2. Use virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment named .venv
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

    Then, activate it:

    ```bash

    .venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows

    ```

## ðŸš€ Usage

```bash
csvdiff path/to/file1.csv path/to/file2.csv
```

## Limitations

- Only supports CSV files with a header row.
- Not suitable for huge CSV files with hundreds of thousands of rows (for 1 million rows, it takes around 50 seconds).
