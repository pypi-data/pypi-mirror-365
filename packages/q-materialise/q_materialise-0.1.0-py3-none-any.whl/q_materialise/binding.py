"""Dynamic import of Qt bindings.

This module attempts to import one of the supported Qt Python bindings
in a well‑defined order: PySide6, PyQt6, PySide2, then PyQt5.  If
none of these are installed an informative :class:`ImportError` is
raised.

The imported modules are re‑exported as ``QtCore``, ``QtGui`` and
``QtWidgets`` so that client code and the rest of this package can
remain agnostic of the underlying binding.  Where there are API
differences between bindings (such as the change from ``exec_`` to
``exec`` in Qt6) the library attempts to cater for them in its own
code.

    This convenience wrapper dispatches to the correct method name
    depending on the Qt binding in use.  Recent versions of PySide and
    PyQt expose an ``exec()`` method on QApplication, while older
    versions used ``exec_()``.  Calling this function hides that
    difference.  Typical usage::

        from q_materialise.binding import exec_  # not required if using inject_style
        app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
        return exec_(app)

        RuntimeError: If the given ``app`` does not provide a
            recognised ``exec`` or ``exec_`` method.
