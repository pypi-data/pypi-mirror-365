"""Base Material Design colours.

This module defines a small collection of base colours that can be
combined with the palette generation functions to produce coherent
tints and shades.  Each entry corresponds to the ``500`` shade from
the official Material Design palette.  You can use these names when
calling :func:`q_materialise.generate_style` or when defining your
own style JSON files.

The values are taken from the Material Design 2014 specification and
are widely published on the web.  See https://material.io/design/color
for the full reference.
