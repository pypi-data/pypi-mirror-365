- **MINOR** version for backwards-compatible functionality additions  
- **PATCH** version for backwards-compatible bug fixes

## Release Process

1. Development happens on the `develop` branch
2. Features are merged via pull requests with required reviews
3. Release candidates are tagged and tested
4. Stable releases are tagged on `main` branch
5. Automatic PyPI publishing via GitHub Actions

## Support Policy

- **Current stable version**: Full support with bug fixes and security updates
- **Previous major version**: Security updates only for 6 months after new major release
- **Older versions**: No support, users encouraged to upgrade

## Migration Notes

### From Native Drivers

When upgrading from native Python database drivers:

1. **Installation**: Replace `pip install mysql-connector-python` with `pip install gosql-connector`
2. **Import**: Change `import mysql.connector` to `import gosql.mysql`
3. **API**: No code changes required - API is fully compatible
4. **Performance**: Expect 2-3x performance improvement automatically
