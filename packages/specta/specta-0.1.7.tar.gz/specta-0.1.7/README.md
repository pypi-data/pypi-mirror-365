<h2 align="center"> A JupyterLite app to present your Jupyter documents in different ways</h2>

Specta is a custom JupyterLite app for rendering notebooks and Jupyterâ€‘supported files in multiple modes: dashboards, blogâ€‘style articles, fullscreen viewers, and more. It is built on top of [JupyterLite](https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite), which allows you to share your documents through alternative interfaces to the IDE-like JupyterLab.

## Features

### Multi-mode Notebook Rendering

Render notebooks in:

- **Dashboard mode** â€“ structured panels for interactive widgets and outputs
- **Article mode** â€“ a minimal, blog-like reading experience

### Clean Viewer for all Jupyter-supported file types

View any Jupyter-supported file using Specta's clean viewer with all Jupyter UI elements removed.

### Preview from JupyterLab

A `specta` preview can be launched directly from JupyterLab, letting users verify how their documents will look when published.

## Installation and Usage

You can install `specta` using `pip` or `conda`

```bash
# Install using pip
pip install specta

# Install using conda
conda install -c conda-forge specta
```

Once installed, you can build your JupyterLite app, a `specta` app will be included automatically in the output directory of `jupyterlite`:

```
jupyter lite build
```

Then serve the contents of the output directory (by default `./_output`) using any static file server. You can access the `specta` app at the `/specta/` path.
