## Usage

*This version of the data sheet is for the version 0.1.9 of the AMFTools library.*

### Example

```python
import amfTools
import time

serial_port = 'COM45'  # (optional) COM port of the product, needs to be changed before using it

list_amf = amfTools.util.getProductList() # Get the list of AMF products connected to the computer
print("\n******* List of AMF products connected to the computer *******")
for amf in list_amf:
    print(amf)
print("**************************************************************\n")

# Connect to the first AMF product of the list
amf : amfTools.AMF = None

try:
    if list_amf:
        amf = amfTools.AMF(list_amf[0])        
    else:
        print("No AMF product found")
        print("Force connection to port " + serial_port)
        try:
            amf = amfTools.AMF(serial_port)
        except Exception as e:
            raise ConnectionError(str(e))
    
    # Check if the product is homed (if not, home it)
    if not amf.getHomeStatus():
        amf.home()
    
    # Move to the port 2, wait 3 seconds and move to the port 4
    amf.valveShortestPath(2) # Blocking function, will return only once the move is done
    print("Valve on port 2")
    time.sleep(3)
    amf.valveShortestPath(4) 
    
    print(f"Valve on port {amf.getValvePosition()}")
    
    # Move to the port 3
    amf.valveShortestPath(3, block= False)  # Non blocking function
    # Wait until the move is done
    amf.pullAndWait()
    print("Valve on port 3")
    print(f"Valve Status: {amf.checkValveStatus()}")
    
finally:
    if amf:
        amf.disconnect()
```
