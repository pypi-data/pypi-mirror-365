"read_file" : """
Reads content from a file with optional line-based pagination.

This tool is intended for reading text files only. It tracks read operations
for later validation in write/edit commands. If the file is binary or unreadable
due to permissions or encoding, it returns a structured error.

Usage:
    await read_file("README.md", offset=1, limit=50)

Args:
    path (str): File path to read.
    offset (Optional[int]): Starting line number (1-based). Defaults to config default.
    limit (Optional[int]): Number of lines to read. Defaults to config default.
    encoding (Optional[str]): Encoding to use. Defaults to system default.

Returns:
    FileReadResponse:
        - content (str): File content (possibly truncated).
        - lines_shown (int), total_lines (int), is_truncated (bool)

Possible Failures:
    - File not found
    - Invalid encoding
    - Binary file (unsupported)
    - Permission issues

Suggestions:
    - Use `list_directory()` or `glob_files()` to find valid file paths.
    - Ensure encoding matches file format.
""",

"write_file" : """
Writes text content to a file, with overwrite protection.

To avoid accidental modification of unknown files, writing to an existing file
requires it to have been read first â€” unless `force=True`.

Usage:
    await write_file("example.txt", "new content", force=True)

Args:
    path (str): Path to file to write.
    content (str): Text content to write.
    force (bool): Set to True to bypass read-before-write check.

Returns:
    FileWriteResponse:
        - bytes_written (int)

Possible Failures:
    - Path invalid or unwritable
    - File not read beforehand (if force=False)
    - Permission or disk issues

Suggestions:
    - Use `read_file()` before editing.
    - Set `force=True` if you're sure you want to overwrite.
""",

"edit_file" : """
Performs text replacement in a file.

Supports both single and full replacement modes. The file must be read first
before edits are allowed for safety.

Usage:

Args:
    path (str): Path to the file to edit.
    old_string (str): Text to search for.
    new_string (str): Replacement text.
    replace_all (bool): If True, replace all instances. Default is first match only.

Returns:
    FileEditResponse:
        - replacements_made (int)
        - preview (str): Change preview (first line diff)

Possible Failures:
    - File unread or not previously read
    - Match string not found
    - Write failure after edit

Suggestions:
    - Use `read_file()` before edit.
    - Ensure exact match in whitespace and formatting.
""",

"list_directory" : """
Lists files and directories in a path with metadata.

Supports ignore patterns (regex) for filtering out noisy entries such as `.git`
or `node_modules`.

Suggestions:
    - Use `glob_files()` to match specific file types.
    - Double-check directory path if result is empty.
""",

"create_bash_session" : """

Sessions preserve environment, working directory, and state across commands.
Use when chaining multiple operations or running interactive shells.

Usage:
    await create_bash_session("dev-shell")

Args:
    session_name (Optional[str]): Name for the session. Defaults to config.

Returns:
    ToolResponse with session creation status.

Possible Failures:
    - Session already exists

Suggestions:

    - Use `close_bash_session()` to close stale sessions.
""",

"run_command" : """

Args:
    command (str): Shell command to run.
    directory (Optional[str]): Working directory.

    - Syntax errors
    - Permission issues

Suggestions:
    - Use `run_bash_session()` for stateful or interactive operations.
""",

"run_bash_session" : """
Runs a command in a persistent interactive bash session.

Use this for programs that require input/output interactivity,
environment continuity, or multi-step workflows.

Suggestion : 
Interactive commands (use interactiev=False more often): Avoid commands that require interactive user input, as this can cause the tool to hang. Use non-interactive flags if available (e.g., npm init -y).

Usage:
    await run_bash_session("python3", session_name="py-dev", interactive=True)

Args:
    command (str): Command to run.
    session_name (Optional[str]): Session name. Defaults to config.
    timeout (Optional[float]): Max run time in seconds.
    interrupt (bool): Interrupt session instead of running command.
    interactive (Optional[bool]): Force interactive mode. checks using possible interactive expects using pyexpect.

Returns:
    CommandResponse:
        - stdout, stderr, session_name, is_interactive, expect_string

Possible Failures:
    - Session creation failed
    - Unexpected command behavior in interactive mode

Suggestions:
    - Avoid long-running sessions without timeout.
    - Use `interrupt=True` to stop hanging sessions.
""",


"glob_files" : """

This tool scans recursively and filters out common noise like `.git`, `node_modules`.
Results are sorted with the newest files first.

Usage:

Args:
    pattern (str): Glob pattern (e.g., "*.py", "**/*.md").
    path (str): Base directory to search.
    case_sensitive (bool): If True, pattern match is case-sensitive.

Returns:
