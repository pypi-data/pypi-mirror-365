class ConvexHull:
    """This class provides functionality for extracting the convex hull
    of the (free) energy of mixing. It is based on the `convex hull
    calculator in SciPy
    <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-dev/reference/\
generated/scipy.spatial.ConvexHull.html>`_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    concentrations
        Concentrations for each structure listed as ``[[c1, c2], [c1, c2],
        ...]``; for binaries, in which case there is only one independent
        concentration, the format ``[c1, c2, c3, ...]`` works as well.
    energies
        Energy (or energy of mixing) for each structure.

    Attributes
    ----------
    concentrations : np.ndarray
        Concentrations of the structures on the convex hull.
    energies : np.ndarray
        Energies of the structures on the convex hull.
    dimensions : int
        Number of independent concentrations needed to specify a point in
        concentration space (1 for binaries, 2 for ternaries and so on).
    structures : List[int]
        Indices of structures that constitute the convex hull (indices are
        defined by the order of their concentrations and energies are fed when
        initializing the :class:`ConvexHull` object).

    Examples
    --------
    A :class:`ConvexHull` object is easily initialized by providing lists of
    concentrations and energies::

        >>> data = {'concentration': [0,    0.2,  0.2,  0.3,  0.4,  0.5,  0.8,  1.0],
        ...         'mixing_energy': [0.1, -0.2, -0.1, -0.2,  0.2, -0.4, -0.2, -0.1]}
        >>> hull = ConvexHull(data['concentration'], data['mixing_energy'])

    Now one can for example access the points along the convex hull directly::

        >>> for c, e in zip(hull.concentrations, hull.energies):
        ...     print(c, e)
        0.0 0.1
        0.2 -0.2
        0.5 -0.4
        1.0 -0.1

    or plot the convex hull along with the original data using e.g., matplotlib::

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> plt.scatter(data['concentration'], data['mixing_energy'], color='darkred')
        >>> plt.plot(hull.concentrations, hull.energies)
        >>> plt.show(block=False)

    It is also possible to extract structures at or close to the convex hull::

        >>> low_energy_structures = hull.extract_low_energy_structures(
        ...     data['concentration'], data['mixing_energy'],
        ...     energy_tolerance=0.005)

    A complete example can be found in the :ref:`basic tutorial
    <tutorial_enumerate_structures>`.
