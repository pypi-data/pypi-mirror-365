    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "TDAstro is a package for large-scale, time-domain forward-modeling of astronomical light curve data. Simulations incorporate realistic effects, including survey cadence, dust extinction, and instrument noise models. TDAstro is designed to enable user extensibility, such as adding new source models, effects, and instruments, while ensuring scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we discuss the overall flow of TDAstro and how to use it to run simulations. The goal is to get a new user started and allow them to explore the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later tutorials cover topics in more depth, including:\n",
    "  - Sampling Parameters (sampling.ipynb) - Provides an introduction to parameters and how they are sampled within a simulation run.\n",
    "  - Adding new source types (adding_sources.ipynb) - Provides a more in-depth discussion of ``PhysicalModel`` subclasses and how to add new sources.\n",
    "  - Add new effect types (addings_effects.ipynb) - Provides a discussion of the ``EffectModel`` class, how it is used, and how to create new subclasses.\n",
    "  - Working directly with passbands (passband-demo.ipynb)\n",
    "  - Working directly with OpSims (opsim_notebook.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Program Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "TDAstro generates synthetic light curves using the flow shown in the illustration below. A `PhysicalModel` (the model of a source) and information about the parameter distributions is used to sample fake sources. These are combined with information from an `OpSim` (or other survey information) to generate sample flux densities at a given set of times and wavelengths (or passbands), accounting for effects such as redshift. The simulator also applies other relevant effects to the rest frame flux densities (e.g. dust extinction) and the observer frame flux densities (detector noise). At the end the code outputs a series of samples."

    "## Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "All light curves are generated from source objects that are a subclass of the `PhysicalModel` class. These source objects provide mechanisms for:\n",
    "  - Sampling their parameters from given distributions,\n",
    "  - Generating flux densities at given times and wavelengths (or passbands), and\n",
    "  - Applying noise and other effects to the observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major goal of TDAstro is to be easily extensible so that users can create and analyze their own source models. See the `adding_sources.ipynb` notebook for examples of how to add a new type of source.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each \"sample\" of the data consists of a new sampling of the source's parameters and a generation of flux densities from those parameters. Thus, when a user generates a hundred samples, they are generating 100 light curves from 100 sample sources. For a detailed description of how sampling works, see the `sampling.ipynb` notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can demonstrate this simulation flow using `SinWaveSource`, a toy model that generates fluxes using a sin wave. The `SinWaveSource` object uses multiple parameters to generate its flux, so we need to speccify how to set these. For some parameters we may have a fixed value, such as a brightness of 100.0. But in most simulations we will want to values of the parameters themselves to vary. We can set these from other nodes (any object that generates or uses parameters). Below we set two of the model's parameters (`frequency` and `t0`) from uniform distributions and two (`RA` and `dec`) are chosen from a Gaussian that matches the toy survey information we will load later in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "TDAstro provides tools for generating parameters from a range of sources and distributions. For example we can sample (RA, dec) directly from the survey data itself. For more information on how to define the parameter settings, see the `sampling.ipynb` notebook."
