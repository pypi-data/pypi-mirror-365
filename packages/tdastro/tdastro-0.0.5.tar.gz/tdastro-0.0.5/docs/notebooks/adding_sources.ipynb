    "# Adding New Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "A major goal of TDAstro is to be easily extensible so that users can create and analyze their own source models. In this tutorial we look at how a user can add a custom source to simulate an astronomical phenomenon that is not already supported by TDAstro. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a new model node\n",
    "\n",
    "All sources are subclasses of the `PhysicalModel` class in `src/tdastro/sources/physical_models.py`. This class implements a bunch of helper functions to handle parameters and simulate the output of an object, but users only need to override two of them to create a new subclass:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The `__init__()` method sets up the parameters.\n",
    "  * The `compute_flux()` draws effect-free observations for the object in the object's rest frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the object has a redshift value, the `PhysicalModel` class takes care of accounting for the shift in both times and wavelengths from the observer's frame to the rest frame (and back). So each source only needs to worry about generating fluxes in their rest frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly effects are applied within the `PhysicalModel` helper functions, so you do not need to worry about calling them from `compute_flux()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameterization\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the introduction_demo notebook, all nodes in TDAStro accept dynamic parameterization. These are parameters that change with each sampling run. For example if we have a node modeling the source's output as a sin wave, we may want to include two parameters: the peak `brightness` of the object and the `frequency` of the underlying wave.  We specify both of these parameters with the `ParameterizedNode`'s `add_parameter()` function. Behind the scenes this function does the heavy lifting to understand how the parameter is actually set during each run (from a constant, another `ParameterizedNode`, the computation of a function, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Model Node\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the example below, which implements the sin wave model.  There are some details in the implementation below that we do not cover immediately (such as the `get_local_params()` function), but will describe below. "

    "\n",
    "Each `ParameterizedNode` is stateless by design, so it does **not** store the values for any of its parameters. Instead it stores information on how to get those values when sampled. Thus the `compute_flux()` function must take a `GraphState` object that contains the parameter information. This is usually generated with a call to `sample_parameters()`, but will also be automatically generated internally if the `evaluate()` function is called without this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `compute_flux()` function can use the `self.get_local_params(graph_state)` to extract the current node's parameters from the `GraphState` object. This function returns a dictionary mapping the parameter's name to its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluating the Node\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual evaluation (computation of the SED) of the source occurs through the object's `evaluate()` function, which internally calls the `compute_flux()` function. Users of the node should call `evaluate()` since that function performs the necessary pre- and post- computations, such as shifting the wavelengths according to the redshift. The developer of a new source only needs to implement the `compute_flux()` function, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** TDAstro is set up to be modular with the foundation code performing most of the heavy listing. This includes most of the functions in `PhysicalModel`, because the base class is set up to consistently apply transformations and effects to all its subclasses.  New effects can be added by creating new subclasses of `EffectModel`. Thus the developers of new sources should avoid overloading or modifying the `evaluate()` function unless they need to fundamentally change how effects are applied."

However we have changed how we specify the parameter. Instead of assigning a constant, we assign the **output** of another node. In this case, the `NumpyRandomFunc` node wraps numpy's random number generator and returns samples from it.

We define another parameter as a function of that given parameter: `accretion_rate` is computed from the blackhole mass. For this second parameter, we feed information from other parameters into a function and return the result. \n",

    "TDAstro's `FunctionNode` class provides a wrapper for such functions. The constructor takes in the function and a list of parameters. It can then be referenced directly to use its output to set parameters in other parts of the model. While the function we show below is simple (only one variable), we can use these types of function nodes to capture complex interactions.  For example the `PhysicalModel` function has the ability to compute an estimated distance from a given redshift and cosmological model."
