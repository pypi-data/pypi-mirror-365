   TDAstro simulation components

The main simulation components in TDAstro include:

* A statistical simulation step where the hyperparameters of the model are drawn
  from one or more prior distributions.
* ``PhysicalModel`` defines the properties of the time-domain source, which can 
  also include a host-galaxy model, and is used to generate the noise-free light curves.
* ``Opsim`` contains the survey information such as survey strategy and observing
  conditions. It is used to specify the observing times and bands.
* A set of predefined effects, such as dust extinction and detector noise, are applied to
  the noise-free light curves to produce realistic light curves.
* The ``PassbandGroup`` contains the filter information of the telescope and is used
  to calculate the fluxes in each band.

See the :doc:`Glossary <glossary>` for definitions of key terms, such as
*GraphState*, *Node*, *Parameter*, *ParameterizedNode*, *PhysicalModel*, and *Source*.

Defining a parameterized model
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The core idea behind TDAstro is that we want to generate light curves from parameterized models
of physical objects. The ``PhysicalModel`` class defines the structure for modeling physical objects.
New object types are derived from the ``PhysicalModel`` base class and implement a ``compute_flux()``
function that generates the noise-free flux densities in the object's rest frame given information about
the times, wavelengths, and model parameters (called graph_state). Both the times and wavelengths are
converted to account for redshift before being passed to the ``compute_flux()`` function.

.. code-block:: python

    def compute_flux(self, times, wavelengths, graph_state, **kwargs):

A user of a particular physical model only needs to understand what parameters the model has
and how they are set. A user creating a new physical model additionally needs to know how the noise-free,
rest frame flux density values are generated from those parameters.

The parameters that are defined by a hierarchical model can be visualized by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
This means that the parameters to our physical model, such as a type Ia supernova, can themselves be sampled
based on distributions of hyperparameters. For example, a simplified SNIa model with a host component
can have the following DAG:

In this example, the parameter ``c`` is drawn from a predefined distribution, while the parameter ``x1``
is drawn from a distribution that is itself parameterized by the ``host_mass`` parameter. TDAstro handles
the sequential processing of the graph so that all parameters are consistently sampled for each object.

See the :doc:`Introduction notebook<notebooks/introduction>` for details on how to
define the parameter DAG.


Generating light curves
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Light curves are generated with a multiple step process. First, the object's parameter DAG is sampled
to get concrete values for each parameter in the model. This combination of parameters is call the graph
state (and stored in a ``GraphState`` object), because it represents the sampled state of the DAG.

Next, the ``OpSim`` is used to determine at what times and in which bands the object will be evaluated.
These times and wavelengths are based into the object's ``eval()`` function along with the graph state.
The ``eval()`` function handles the mechanics of the simulation, such as applying redshifts to both the
times and wavelengths before calling the ``compute_flux()``.

Additional effects can be applied to the noise-free light curves to produce more realistic light curves.
The effects are applied in two batches. Rest frame effects are applied to the flux densities in the frame.
The flux densities are then converted to the observer frame where the observer frame effects are applied.

Finally, the raw flux densities are are converted into the magnitudes observed in each band using the
``PassbandGroup``.


Examples
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After loading the necessary information (such as ``PassbandGroup`` and ``Opsim``),
and defining the ``PhysicalModel``, we can generate light curves with realistic
cadence and noise.
