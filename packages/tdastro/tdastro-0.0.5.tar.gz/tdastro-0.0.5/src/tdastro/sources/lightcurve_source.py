"""Model that generate the SED or bandflux of a source based on given observer frame
lightcurves of fluxes in each band.

If we are generating the bandfluxes directly, the models interpolate the given lightcurves

class LightcurveData:
    """A class to hold data for a single model lightcurve (set of fluxes over time for
    each filter).

    Attributes
    ----------
    lightcurves : dict
        A dictionary mapping filter names to a 2D array of the bandfluxes in that filter,
        where the first column is time (in days from the reference time of the light curve)
        and the second column is the bandflux (in nJy).
    lc_t0 : float
        The reference epoch (t0) of the input light curve. The model will be shifted
        to the model's t0 when computing fluxes. For periodic lightcurves, this either
        must be set to the first time of the lightcurve or left as 0.0 to automatically
        derive the lc_t0 from the lightcurve.
    period : float or None
        The period of the lightcurve in days. If the lightcurve is not periodic,
        then this value is set to None.
    min_times : dict
        A dictionary mapping filter names to the minimum time of the lightcurve
        in that filter (relative to lc_t0).
    max_times : dict
        A dictionary mapping filter names to the maximum time of the lightcurve
        in that filter (relative to lc_t0).
    baseline : dict
        A dictionary of baseline bandfluxes for each filter. This is only used
        for non-periodic lightcurves when they are not active.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lightcurves : dict or numpy.ndarray
        The lightcurves can be passed as either:
        1) a dictionary mapping filter names to a (T, 2) array of the bandlfuxes in that filter
        where the first column is time and the second column is the flux density (in nJy), or
        2) a numpy array of shape (T, 3) array where the first column is time (in days), the
        second column is the bandflux (in nJy), and the third column is the filter.
    lc_t0 : float
        The reference epoch (t0) of the input light curve. The model will be shifted
        to the model's t0 when computing fluxes.  For periodic lightcurves, this either
        must be set to the first time of the lightcurve or left as 0.0 to automatically
        derive the lc_t0 from the lightcurve.
        Default: 0.0
    periodic : bool
        Whether the lightcurve is periodic. If True, the model will assume that
        the lightcurve repeats every period.
        Default: False
    baseline : dict or None
        A dictionary of baseline bandfluxes for each filter. This is only used

class LightcurveSource(BaseLightcurveSource):
    """A model that generates either the SED or bandflux of a source based on
    given lightcurves in each band. When generating the bandflux, it interpolates
    the lightcurves directly. When generating the SED, the model uses a box-shaped SED
    for each filter such that the resulting flux density is equal to the lightcurve's
    value after passing through the passband filter.

    LightcurveSource supports both periodic and non-periodic lightcurves. If the
    light curve is not periodic then each lightcurve's given values will be interpolated
    during the time range of the lightcurve. Values outside the time range (before and
    after) will be set to the baseline value for that filter (0.0 by default).

    Periodic models require that each filter's lightcurve is sampled at the same times
    and that the value at the end of the lightcurve is equal to the value at the start
    of the lightcurve. The lightcurve epoch (lc_t0) is automatically set to the first time
    so that the t0 parameter corresponds to the shift in phase.

    The set of passbands used to configure the model MUST be the same as used
    to generate the SED (the wavelengths must match).

    Parameterized values include:
      * dec - The object's declination in degrees.
      * ra - The object's right ascension in degrees.
      * t0 - The t0 of the zero phase (if applicable), date.

    Attributes
    ----------
    lightcurves : LightcurveData
        The data for the lightcurves, such as the times and bandfluxes in each filter.
    sed_values : dict
        A dictionary mapping filters to the SED basis values for that passband.
        These SED values are scaled by the lightcurve and added for the
        final SED.
    all_waves : numpy.ndarray
        A 1d array of all of the wavelengths used by the passband group.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lightcurves : dict or numpy.ndarray
        The lightcurves can be passed as either:
        1) a LightcurveData instance,
        2) a dictionary mapping filter names to a (T, 2) array of the bandlfuxes in that filter
        where the first column is time and the second column is the flux density (in nJy), or
        3) a numpy array of shape (T, 3) array where the first column is time (in days), the
        second column is the bandflux (in nJy), and the third column is the filter.
    passbands : Passband or PassbandGroup
        The passband or passband group to use for defining the lightcurve.
    lc_t0 : float
        The reference epoch (t0) of the input light curve. The model will be shifted
        to the model's t0 when computing fluxes.  For periodic lightcurves, this either
        must be set to the first time of the lightcurve or left as 0.0 to automatically
        derive the lc_t0 from the lightcurve.
        Default: 0.0
    periodic : bool
        Whether the lightcurve is periodic. If True, the model will assume that
        the lightcurve repeats every period.
        Default: False
    baseline : dict or None
        A dictionary of baseline bandfluxes for each filter. This is only used
