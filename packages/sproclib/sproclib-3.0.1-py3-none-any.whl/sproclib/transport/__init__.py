Transport Modules for SPROCLIB - Standard Process Control Library

This package contains transport models for different phases and operating modes:

Continuous Transport:
- Liquid: PipeFlow, PeristalticFlow, SlurryPipeline
- Solid: PneumaticConveying, ConveyorBelt, GravityChute, ScrewFeeder

Batch Transport:
- Liquid: BatchTransferPumping
- Solid: DrumBinTransfer, VacuumTransfer
