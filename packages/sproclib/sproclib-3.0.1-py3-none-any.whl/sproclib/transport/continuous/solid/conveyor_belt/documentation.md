# ConveyorBelt Model Documentation

## Overview

The ConveyorBelt class provides a mathematical model for continuous solid material transport using belt conveyors. This model is essential for bulk material handling systems in mining, manufacturing, and processing industries.

## Use Case

Belt conveyors are widely used for:
- Bulk material transport in mining operations
- Assembly line material handling
- Grain and aggregate conveying
- Waste material transport
- Continuous process feed systems

## Algorithm Description

The ConveyorBelt model implements:

1. **Material Flow Calculation**: Based on belt dimensions, speed, and material properties
2. **Power Consumption Model**: Including horizontal transport, vertical lifting, and friction losses
3. **Dynamic Response**: Transport delay and motor response characteristics

### Steady-State Model

The steady-state material flow rate is calculated as:

```
material_area = belt_width × load_height × belt_load_factor
theoretical_flow = material_area × belt_speed × material_density
actual_flow = min(theoretical_flow, feed_rate)
```

### Power Calculation

Total power consumption includes:

```
horizontal_power = material_weight × belt_speed × rolling_resistance_factor
vertical_power = material_weight × belt_speed × sin(belt_angle)
belt_friction_power = constant_friction_power
total_power = horizontal_power + vertical_power + belt_friction_power
```

### Dynamic Model

The dynamic response considers:
- Transport delay: `τ_flow = belt_length/belt_speed + settling_time`
- Motor dynamics: `τ_power = 2.0 s`

## Parameters

| Parameter | Unit | Description | Typical Range |
|-----------|------|-------------|---------------|
| belt_length | m | Belt length | 10-1000 |
| belt_width | m | Belt width | 0.5-3.0 |
| belt_speed | m/s | Belt speed | 0.1-5.0 |
| belt_angle | rad | Inclination angle | 0-0.52 (0-30°) |
| material_density | kg/m³ | Bulk material density | 500-3000 |
| friction_coefficient | - | Material-belt friction | 0.3-0.8 |
| belt_load_factor | - | Belt loading factor | 0.3-1.0 |
| motor_power | W | Motor power | 1000-100000 |

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs
- **feed_rate** (kg/s): Material feed rate to the belt
- **belt_speed_setpoint** (m/s): Desired belt speed
- **material_load_height** (m): Height of material on belt

### Outputs
- **material_flow_rate** (kg/s): Actual material flow rate
- **power_consumption** (W): Motor power consumption

## Working Ranges

- **Belt Speed**: 0.1-5.0 m/s (optimal: 1-3 m/s)
- **Belt Angle**: 0-30° (steep angles require cleats or textured belts)
- **Material Density**: 500-3000 kg/m³
- **Loading Factor**: 0.3-1.0 (0.8 typical for good operation)

## Equations

### Material Flow
```
Q = A_material × v_belt × ρ_bulk
```
where:
- Q = mass flow rate (kg/s)
- A_material = cross-sectional area of material (m²)
- v_belt = belt velocity (m/s)
- ρ_bulk = bulk density (kg/m³)

### Power Requirements
```
P_total = P_horizontal + P_vertical + P_friction
P_horizontal = W_material × v_belt × μ_rolling
P_vertical = W_material × v_belt × sin(θ)
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Design Considerations
- Select belt speed based on material characteristics and lump size
- Ensure adequate motor power for peak loading conditions
- Consider maintenance access and safety requirements
- Account for material spillage and dust generation

### Operational Limits
- Maximum inclination depends on material friction properties
- Belt loading should not exceed design capacity
- Monitor power consumption for overload detection
- Regular belt tracking and tension maintenance required

### Applications
- Coal and ore transport in mining
- Aggregate handling in construction
- Food processing conveyor systems
- Airport baggage handling
- Recycling and waste management
