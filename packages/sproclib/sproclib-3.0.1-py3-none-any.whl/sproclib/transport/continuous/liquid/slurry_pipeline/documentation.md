# SlurryPipeline Class Documentation

## Overview

The `SlurryPipeline` class models the transport of solid-liquid mixtures (slurries) through pipelines in industrial processes. This model accounts for the complex interactions between solid particles and the carrier fluid, including settling, suspension, and additional pressure losses due to particle-fluid interactions.

## Scientific Background

### Slurry Flow Fundamentals

Slurry transport involves the movement of solid particles suspended in a liquid carrier through pipelines. The behavior is significantly more complex than single-phase liquid flow due to:

1. **Particle-Fluid Interactions**: Drag forces, buoyancy, and virtual mass effects
2. **Particle-Particle Interactions**: Collisions, agglomeration, and segregation
3. **Wall Effects**: Particle-wall interactions and wear
4. **Flow Regime Dependencies**: Settling, suspension, and deposit formation

### Key Phenomena

#### Particle Settling

In the absence of turbulence, particles settle according to Stokes' law (for small particles) or Newton's drag law (for larger particles):

**Stokes' Law (Re_p < 1):**
```
v_s = (ρ_s - ρ_f) × g × d_p² / (18 × μ_f)
```

**Newton's Law (Re_p > 1000):**
```
v_s = √[(4 × (ρ_s - ρ_f) × g × d_p) / (3 × ρ_f × C_D)]
```

Where:
- v_s = Settling velocity [m/s]
- ρ_s, ρ_f = Solid and fluid densities [kg/m³]
- g = Gravitational acceleration [m/s²]
- d_p = Particle diameter [m]
- μ_f = Fluid viscosity [Pa·s]
- C_D = Drag coefficient [-]

#### Critical Velocity

The critical velocity is the minimum velocity required to prevent particle settling and maintain suspension:

**Durand-Condolios Equation:**
```
v_c = F_L × √[2 × g × D × (S_s - 1)]
```

Where:
- v_c = Critical velocity [m/s]
- F_L = Durand factor (typically 0.4-1.8)
- D = Pipe diameter [m]
- S_s = Specific gravity of solids (ρ_s/ρ_f)

#### Pressure Loss

Total pressure loss in slurry pipelines includes:

1. **Carrier Fluid Loss**: Standard friction loss for clear liquid
2. **Additional Particle Loss**: Due to particle-fluid interactions
3. **Gravitational Effects**: Buoyancy and density differences

**Total Pressure Loss:**
```
ΔP_total = ΔP_fluid + ΔP_particles + ΔP_gravity
```

**Particle Contribution (Simplified):**
```
ΔP_particles = K × C_v × (ρ_s - ρ_f) × g × L
```

Where:
- K = Empirical factor depending on flow conditions
- C_v = Volumetric concentration of solids [-]
- L = Pipeline length [m]

### Flow Regimes

Slurry flow exhibits several distinct regimes:

1. **Homogeneous Flow**: Particles fully suspended, uniform distribution
2. **Heterogeneous Flow**: Non-uniform particle distribution with settling tendency
3. **Flow with Moving Bed**: Particles form a moving layer at the bottom
4. **Flow with Stationary Bed**: Some particles deposited and stationary

### Rheological Effects

Slurries often exhibit non-Newtonian behavior:

1. **Pseudo-plastic**: Shear-thinning behavior
2. **Dilatant**: Shear-thickening behavior  
3. **Bingham Plastic**: Yield stress and linear flow curve
4. **Thixotropic**: Time-dependent viscosity changes
