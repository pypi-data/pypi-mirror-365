# steady_state Function Documentation

## Overview

The `steady_state` functions in the liquid transport models calculate equilibrium flow conditions for continuous operation. These functions solve the governing equations for pressure drop, flow characteristics, and transport properties under steady-state assumptions.

## Scientific Background

### Steady-State Analysis Principles

Steady-state analysis assumes that all time derivatives are zero, meaning the system has reached equilibrium conditions where:

1. **Flow rates are constant** throughout the system
2. **Pressures and velocities are time-invariant** at each location
3. **Mass and energy balances** are satisfied
4. **All transient effects** have dissipated

This approach is fundamental for:
- **System design** and sizing calculations
- **Performance prediction** under normal operating conditions
- **Control system analysis** using linearized models
- **Economic optimization** of operating parameters

### Mathematical Foundation

For pipe flow systems, steady-state analysis involves solving:

1. **Continuity Equation:**
   ```
   Q = A × v = constant
   ```

2. **Momentum Balance (Pressure Drop):**
   ```
   ΔP = f(Re, ε/D) × (L/D) × (ρv²/2) + ρgh
   ```

3. **Energy Balance:**
   ```
   h₁ + v₁²/(2g) + P₁/ρg = h₂ + v₂²/(2g) + P₂/ρg + h_loss
   ```

Where the head loss includes friction, fittings, and other losses.

## Integration with Control Systems

### Linear Approximations

For control system design, steady_state functions provide linearization points:

```python
# Calculate steady-state operating point
ss_result = model.steady_state(nominal_flow)

# Numerical derivatives for linearization
dP_dQ = (model.steady_state(flow + delta) - model.steady_state(flow - delta)) / (2 * delta)
```

### Transfer Function Development

Steady-state gains are essential for control loop design:

```python
# Steady-state process gain
K_p = delta_pressure / delta_flow

# Used in PID controller tuning
# P_controller = K_c * error
# where K_c is based on K_p
```
