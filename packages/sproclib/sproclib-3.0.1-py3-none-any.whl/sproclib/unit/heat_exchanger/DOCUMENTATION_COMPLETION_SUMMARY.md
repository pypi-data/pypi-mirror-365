✅ Referenced standard chemical engineering principles (effectiveness-NTU, LMTD)  
✅ Mentioned where heat exchangers fit in process plants (preheat trains, cooling)  
✅ Included dimensionless numbers (NTU, effectiveness, heat capacity ratios)  
✅ Showed scale-up considerations (area density, heat flux, velocities)  
✅ Compared with industrial practice and typical design values  

**AVOIDED:**
✅ Programming implementation details  
✅ Extensive code explanations  
✅ Computer science jargon
