Process Models Overview
----------------------

**HeatExchanger**: Counter-current shell-and-tube heat exchanger for thermal energy recovery and process heating/cooling. 
Employs effectiveness-NTU method for optimal design in crude oil preheat trains, chemical reactor cooling systems, 
and heat integration networks. Features dynamic thermal response modeling for process control applications.

Unit Operations Context
----------------------

Heat exchangers are critical equipment in chemical process plants, serving multiple functions:

**Heat Recovery Operations:**
- Energy integration between hot and cold process streams
- Waste heat recovery from reactor effluents and distillation overheads  
- Preheating feed streams using product heat content

**Process Temperature Control:**
- Reactor cooling to maintain optimal reaction temperatures
- Product cooling to specification temperatures for downstream processing
- Heating utilities for endothermic processes and startup operations

**Mass Transfer Enhancement:**
- Condensation and vaporization in separation equipment
- Reboiler and condenser duties in distillation columns
- Heat input/removal for absorption and stripping operations

**Integration with Plant Utilities:**
- Steam generation and condensate return systems
- Cooling water circuits for process heat removal
- Thermal oil systems for high-temperature heating applications

**Design Philosophy:**
The models emphasize chemical engineering fundamentals including heat transfer coefficients, 
thermal effectiveness, pressure drop considerations, and fouling resistance. Industrial-scale 
parameters and realistic process conditions ensure applicability to actual plant operations
and process optimization studies.
