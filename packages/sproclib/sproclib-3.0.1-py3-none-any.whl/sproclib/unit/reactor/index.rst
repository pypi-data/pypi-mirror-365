Reactor Model Descriptions
-------------------------

Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CSTR model simulates a well-mixed continuous reactor with constant volume operation. It features:

- Arrhenius reaction kinetics
- Energy balance with jacket cooling/heating
- Steady-state and dynamic analysis capabilities
- Performance metrics calculation

**Applications:** Liquid-phase reactions, polymerization, biochemical processes

Batch Reactor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Batch Reactor model represents a closed system with batch operation and temperature control:

- Time-dependent concentration and temperature profiles
- Batch time calculations for target conversions
- Heat transfer through jacket system
- Safety analysis for runaway reactions

**Applications:** Pharmaceutical manufacturing, specialty chemicals, process development

Plug Flow Reactor (PFR)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PFR model uses axial discretization to simulate tubular reactors:

- Axial concentration and temperature profiles
- No back-mixing assumption
- Heat transfer to reactor walls
- Suitable for gas-phase and high-conversion reactions

**Applications:** Tubular reactors, fired heaters, catalytic cracking

Fixed Bed Reactor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Fixed Bed Reactor model simulates packed bed catalytic reactors:

- Heterogeneous catalysis with solid catalyst particles
- Bed porosity and catalyst loading effects
- Axial profiles with heat and mass transfer
- Pressure drop calculations

**Applications:** Catalytic processes, petrochemicals, environmental cleanup

Semi-Batch Reactor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Semi-Batch Reactor model combines batch and continuous operation:

- Fed-batch operation with controlled addition
- Variable volume operation
- Temperature and concentration control
- Optimal feeding strategies

**Applications:** Fine chemicals, controlled polymerization, crystallization

Fluidized Bed Reactor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Fluidized Bed Reactor model simulates two-phase fluidized systems:

- Bubble and emulsion phase modeling
- Fluidization regime characterization
- Heat and mass transfer between phases
- Catalyst circulation effects

**Applications:** Fluid catalytic cracking, coal combustion, polymerization

Model Features
--------------

Common Capabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All reactor models provide:

- **Dynamic Simulation:** Time-dependent behavior using ODE solvers
- **Steady-State Analysis:** Equilibrium operating point calculation
- **Performance Metrics:** Conversion, selectivity, space-time yield
- **Parameter Estimation:** Kinetic and design parameter fitting
- **Safety Analysis:** Temperature runaway and stability assessment

Model Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each model includes:

- **Test Suites:** Unit tests for all methods and edge cases
- **Example Applications:** Realistic case studies with output
- **Documentation:** Theory, equations, and usage guidelines
- **Literature References:** Validation against published data

Usage Guidelines
---------------

Model Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Choose reactor models based on:

- **Mixing Characteristics:** Perfect mixing (CSTR/Batch) vs. plug flow (PFR)
- **Operation Mode:** Continuous, batch, or semi-batch
- **Phase System:** Homogeneous vs. heterogeneous catalysis
- **Scale Requirements:** Laboratory, pilot, or industrial scale

Parameter Estimation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For accurate simulations:

- Use experimental kinetic data for rate parameters
- Validate heat transfer coefficients with plant data
- Consider temperature and composition dependencies
- Account for mass transfer limitations in catalytic systems

Safety Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Important safety aspects:

- **Thermal Runaway:** Monitor temperature profiles and cooling capacity
- **Pressure Relief:** Consider gas generation and expansion effects
- **Catalyst Deactivation:** Account for activity decline over time
- **Emergency Scenarios:** Design for cooling failure and power outages
