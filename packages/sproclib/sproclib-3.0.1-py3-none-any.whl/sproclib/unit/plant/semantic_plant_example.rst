   :language: python
   :caption: Complete Semantic Plant Example

This example shows how to build complete chemical plants using TensorFlow/Keras-style syntax.

Key Features Demonstrated
------------------------

* Sequential unit addition like neural network layers
* Functional connections between process units
* Compilation and optimization like ML model training
* Plant-wide analysis and performance metrics
* Industrial-grade calculations with simple syntax

The semantic plant design API makes chemical engineering as intuitive as machine learning.
