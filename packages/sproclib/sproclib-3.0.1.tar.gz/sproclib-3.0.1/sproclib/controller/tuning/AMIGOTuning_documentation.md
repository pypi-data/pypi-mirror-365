# AMIGOTuning Documentation

The AMIGOTuning class implements the AMIGO (Approximate M-constrained Integral Gain Optimization) tuning method for PID controllers. Developed by Åström and Hägglund, AMIGO provides improved performance over classical methods like Ziegler-Nichols while maintaining simplicity and robustness for chemical process control applications.

## Theory and Applications

AMIGO tuning is based on optimizing the integral gain while constraining the maximum sensitivity (Ms) to ensure robust stability. This approach addresses limitations of classical tuning methods by:

- **Balancing performance and robustness** through Ms constraints
- **Optimizing for typical process characteristics** found in chemical industries
- **Providing systematic tuning rules** for different process types
- **Handling dead time processes** more effectively than classical methods

### Mathematical Foundation

**Process Model**

AMIGO tuning assumes a First-Order Plus Dead Time (FOPDT) model:

G(s) = (Kp × e^(-Ls)) / (Ts + 1)

Where:
- Kp = Process gain
- T = Time constant  
- L = Dead time

**AMIGO Tuning Rules**

For PI Control:
- Kc = (0.15/Kp) × (T/L)^0.924
- τI = 0.35 × L × (T/L)^0.738

For PID Control:
- Kc = (0.2/Kp) × (T/L)^0.916  
- τI = 0.42 × L × (T/L)^0.738
- τD = 0.08 × L × (T/L)^0.884

**Robustness Constraint**

Maximum sensitivity Ms ≤ 1.4 ensures:
- Gain margin ≥ 2.8
- Phase margin ≥ 43°
- Stable operation with model uncertainty

## Industrial Applications

### Reactor Temperature Control

For exothermic reactor temperature control with cooling water:

**Process Identification:**
- Step test: 2 L/min cooling water increase
- Temperature drops 8°C (Kp = -4 K/(L/min))
- Time constant: T = 15 minutes
- Dead time: L = 2 minutes
- Normalized dead time: τ = L/T = 0.133

**AMIGO PI Tuning:**
- Kc = (0.15/4) × (15/2)^0.924 = 0.0375 × 6.8 = 0.255 (L/min)/K
- τI = 0.35 × 2 × (15/2)^0.738 = 0.7 × 5.9 = 4.1 minutes

**Performance Benefits:**
- Faster disturbance rejection than ZN tuning
- Smoother control action reduces thermal stress
- Better load regulation for feed temperature changes

### Distillation Column Pressure Control

For distillation column pressure control via condenser duty:

**Process Characteristics:**
- Kp = -0.15 kPa per kW cooling
- T = 8 minutes (vapor dynamics)
- L = 1.2 minutes (pressure transmitter lag)
- τ = 0.15

**AMIGO PID Tuning:**
- Kc = (0.2/0.15) × (8/1.2)^0.916 = 1.33 × 6.1 = 8.1 kW/kPa
- τI = 0.42 × 1.2 × (8/1.2)^0.738 = 0.504 × 5.2 = 2.6 minutes
- τD = 0.08 × 1.2 × (8/1.2)^0.884 = 0.096 × 5.8 = 0.56 minutes

**Advantages:**
- Tight pressure control maintains separation efficiency
- Fast response to condenser fouling disturbances
- Reduced energy consumption through better control

### Heat Exchanger Network Control

For heat exchanger outlet temperature control:

**Process Model:**
- Kp = 2.8 °C per kg/h steam
- T = 22 minutes (thermal time constant)
- L = 3.5 minutes (dead time)
- τ = 0.16

**AMIGO PI Tuning (PI preferred for temperature):**
- Kc = (0.15/2.8) × (22/3.5)^0.924 = 0.0536 × 5.9 = 0.316 (kg/h)/°C
- τI = 0.35 × 3.5 × (22/3.5)^0.738 = 1.225 × 5.1 = 6.2 minutes

**Economic Impact:**
- 8% reduction in steam consumption vs. manual control
- Improved heat transfer coefficient through stable operation
- Extended equipment life from smoother control action

## Design Guidelines

### Process Classification

**Type A Processes (τ < 0.2):**

- PI control recommended

### Controller Type Selection
