# Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) Model

## Use Case

The CSTR model simulates a continuous stirred tank reactor with Arrhenius kinetics and energy balance. It is used for analyzing chemical reactions in well-mixed conditions with continuous feed and discharge streams. The model incorporates reaction kinetics, heat generation, and heat transfer with a jacket cooling system.

## Algorithm

The CSTR model implements a dynamic system based on material and energy balances:

### Material Balance
```
dCA/dt = q/V*(CAi - CA) - k(T)*CA
```

### Energy Balance  
```
dT/dt = q/V*(Ti - T) + (-dHr)*k(T)*CA/(rho*Cp) + UA*(Tc - T)/(V*rho*Cp)
```

### Reaction Kinetics
The reaction rate follows the Arrhenius equation:
```
k(T) = k0 * exp(-Ea/(R*T))
```

### Steady State Solution
Steady-state conditions are found by solving:
```
dCA/dt = 0 and dT/dt = 0
```
using numerical methods (scipy.optimize.fsolve).
