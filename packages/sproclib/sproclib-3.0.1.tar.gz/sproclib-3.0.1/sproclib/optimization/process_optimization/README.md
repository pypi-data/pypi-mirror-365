## Mathematical Foundation

### Objective Function Formulation
```
minimize: f(x) = Capital_Cost(x) + PV(Operating_Cost(x))
subject to: g(x) ≤ 0  (inequality constraints)
           h(x) = 0  (equality constraints)
           x_min ≤ x ≤ x_max  (bounds)
```

Where:
- `x`: Design variables (temperatures, pressures, sizes, compositions)
- `Capital_Cost(x)`: Equipment and installation costs
- `Operating_Cost(x)`: Utilities, maintenance, and raw materials
- `PV()`: Present value calculation over project lifetime

### Engineering Cost Models

#### Equipment Sizing
Equipment costs typically follow power-law scaling:
```
Cost = Base_Cost × (Size/Base_Size)^scaling_factor
```

Common scaling factors:
- Vessels and tanks: 0.6-0.7
- Heat exchangers: 0.6-0.8
- Pumps and compressors: 0.7-0.8
- Distillation columns: 0.6-0.9

#### Utility Costs
- Steam: $8-15/GJ (depends on pressure level)
- Electricity: $0.06-0.12/kWh (industrial rates)
- Cooling water: $0.05-0.10/m³
- Refrigeration: $15-30/GJ

## Usage Examples

### Basic Reactor Optimization
```python
from sproclib.optimization.process_optimization import ProcessOptimization

# Create optimizer
optimizer = ProcessOptimization("Reactor Design")

# Define objective function
def reactor_cost(x):
    volume = x[0]  # m³
    temperature = x[1]  # K
    
    # Calculate capital cost
    capital = 50000 * volume**0.6
    
    # Calculate operating cost
    heating_duty = volume * (temperature - 298) * 1000  # W
    operating = heating_duty * 0.08 * 8760  # $/year
    
    return capital + 10 * operating

# Set bounds and constraints
bounds = [(1, 100), (350, 450)]  # volume and temperature limits

# Optimize
result = optimizer.optimize(reactor_cost, [10, 400], bounds=bounds)
```

### Heat Exchanger Network Optimization
```python
# Multi-variable optimization for heat exchanger design
def heat_exchanger_cost(x):
    area, tube_passes, shell_passes = x
    
    # Heat transfer calculations
    U = heat_transfer_coefficient(tube_passes, shell_passes)
    Q = U * area * LMTD
    
    # Cost calculation
    capital = 20000 + 800 * area + 5000 * (tube_passes + shell_passes)
    pressure_drop_cost = pressure_drop_penalty(tube_passes, area)
    
    return capital + 15 * pressure_drop_cost

# Complex constraints
constraints = [
    {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: heat_duty_constraint(x)},
    {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda x: pressure_limit_constraint(x)}
]

result = optimizer.optimize(heat_exchanger_cost, [200, 2, 1], 
                          bounds=[(50, 1000), (1, 4), (1, 2)],
                          constraints=constraints)
```

## Advanced Features

### Multi-objective Optimization
The class supports Pareto optimization for competing objectives:
```python
# Trade-off between cost and environmental impact
def multi_objective(x):
    cost = calculate_total_cost(x)
    emissions = calculate_co2_emissions(x)
    return [cost, emissions]

# Pareto frontier generation
pareto_results = optimizer.multi_objective_optimize(multi_objective, x0, bounds)
```

### Robust Optimization
Handle uncertainty in process parameters:
```python
# Optimize considering parameter uncertainty
def robust_objective(x):
    # Monte Carlo evaluation under uncertainty
    costs = []
    for scenario in uncertainty_scenarios:
        cost = evaluate_cost(x, scenario)
        costs.append(cost)
    
    # Return mean + penalty for variance
    return np.mean(costs) + 0.1 * np.std(costs)
```

### Dynamic Optimization
Time-dependent optimization for batch processes:
```python
# Optimal temperature profile for batch reactor
def batch_reactor_objective(temperature_profile):
    # Simulate batch with given temperature profile
    conversion, selectivity = simulate_batch(temperature_profile)
    
    # Objective: maximize profit
    revenue = conversion * selectivity * product_value
    cost = calculate_heating_cost(temperature_profile)
    
    return -(revenue - cost)  # Minimize negative profit
```

## Integration with Other Modules

### Process Simulation
```python
from sproclib.simulation import ProcessSimulator

# Combine optimization with rigorous simulation
simulator = ProcessSimulator()

def rigorous_objective(x):
    # Set design variables in simulator
    simulator.set_variables(x)
    
    # Run simulation
    results = simulator.solve()
    
    # Extract economic metrics
    return results.total_cost
```

### Control System Design
```python
from sproclib.controller import PIDController

# Optimize controller parameters
def control_objective(params):
    kp, ki, kd = params
    controller = PIDController(kp, ki, kd)
    
    # Simulate closed-loop performance
    performance = simulate_control(controller)
    
    # Minimize IAE + penalty for instability
    return performance.iae + stability_penalty(performance)
```
