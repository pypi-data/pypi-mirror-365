Transport Package
=================

The transport package provides comprehensive modeling capabilities for fluid and material transport
systems in process control applications. This package contains models for continuous and batch
transport operations across different phases and flow regimes.

.. note::
   This is part of the modern modular structure of SPROCLIB. The transport package includes
   advanced physics-based models for process engineering applications.

Package Overview
----------------

The transport package is organized by operational mode and provides comprehensive modeling for:

**Continuous Transport Operations**:

* **Liquid Transport** - PipeFlow, PeristalticFlow, SlurryPipeline
* **Solid Transport** - PneumaticConveying, ConveyorBelt, GravityChute, ScrewFeeder

**Batch Transport Operations**:

* **Liquid Transfer** - BatchTransferPumping
* **Solid Handling** - DrumBinTransfer, VacuumTransfer

All transport models inherit from the ProcessModel base class and provide both steady-state and dynamic analysis capabilities for comprehensive system characterization.

Detailed Model Documentation
----------------------------

Single-Phase Pipeline Flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See detailed documentation: :doc:`../transport/continuous/liquid/PipeFlow`

The ``PipeFlow`` class implements comprehensive pipeline transport modeling for clean
liquids using the Darcy-Weisbach equation and friction factor correlations. Features include
pressure drop calculations, Reynolds number analysis, temperature-dependent properties, and
multiple friction factor correlations.

Positive Displacement Pumping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See detailed documentation: :doc:`../transport/continuous/liquid/PeristalticFlow`

The ``PeristalticFlow`` class models peristaltic pump systems for precise fluid metering and
chemical transfer applications. Features include precise flow control, pulsation analysis,
backpressure compensation, and tube wear modeling.

Multiphase Slurry Transport
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See detailed documentation: :doc:`../transport/continuous/liquid/SlurryPipeline`

The ``SlurryPipeline`` class provides multiphase transport modeling for solid-liquid slurry
systems. Features include critical velocity prediction, particle settling effects, multiphase
pressure drop calculations, and operating envelope determination.

Batch Liquid Transfer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See detailed documentation: :doc:`../transport/batch/liquid/BatchTransferPumping`

The ``BatchTransferPumping`` class models batch liquid transfer operations using pumps with
comprehensive hydraulic analysis. Features include batch volume control, transfer time
optimization, pump performance integration, and level control capabilities.

Pipeline Flow Analysis::

    from transport.continuous.liquid import PipeFlow
    
    # Create pipeline model
    pipe = PipeFlow(
        pipe_length=1000.0,      # 1 km pipeline
