Continuous Solid Transport
==========================

This module provides models for continuous solid transport equipment commonly used in chemical engineering and process industries. These models simulate the behavior of mechanical and pneumatic systems for moving bulk solids in steady-state and dynamic operations.

Equipment Overview
------------------

The solid transport module includes four main equipment types:

**ConveyorBelt**
   Belt conveyor systems for horizontal and inclined transport of bulk solids. Widely used for high-capacity, long-distance material handling in mining, chemical processing, and manufacturing operations. Features include variable speed control, load monitoring, and power optimization.

**GravityChute**
   Gravitational flow systems using inclined chutes and slides. Energy-efficient transport method ideal for downward material movement in storage and processing facilities. Applications include ore handling, grain processing, and waste management systems.

**PneumaticConveying**
   Gas-assisted solid transport through pipelines using pressure differentials. Offers flexible routing and enclosed transport for powders and granular materials. Supports both dilute phase (high velocity) and dense phase (low velocity) conveying modes.

**ScrewFeeder**
   Rotating screw mechanisms for controlled, metered feeding of bulk solids. Provides excellent flow control and minimal material segregation. Essential for dosing, blending, and feeding operations in chemical, pharmaceutical, and food processing.

Process Applications
--------------------

These transport systems are fundamental to various chemical engineering processes:

- **Material Handling**: Bulk solid movement between process units
- **Storage and Reclaim**: Silo discharge and warehouse operations  
- **Process Feeding**: Controlled material introduction to reactors and mixers
- **Product Packaging**: Final product transport to packaging lines
- **Waste Management**: By-product and waste material handling

Design Considerations
---------------------

Key factors in solid transport system design:

- **Material Properties**: Particle size, density, flowability, and abrasiveness
- **Capacity Requirements**: Flow rates from kg/h to thousands of t/h
- **Transport Distance**: Short-distance feeding vs. long-distance conveying
- **Environmental Conditions**: Indoor/outdoor, temperature, humidity effects
- **Control Requirements**: Variable flow rates, start/stop operations
- **Maintenance Access**: Cleanability, wear part replacement, inspection
