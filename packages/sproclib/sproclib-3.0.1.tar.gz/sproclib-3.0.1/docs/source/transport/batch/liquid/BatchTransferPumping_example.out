7. SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
Batch transfer pumping analysis completed successfully.
Key findings:
- Water transfer is faster due to lower viscosity and higher pump capacity
- Oil transfer requires more time due to higher viscosity and smaller pump
- Both systems operate in different Reynolds number regimes
- Pump sizing affects transfer efficiency and time
