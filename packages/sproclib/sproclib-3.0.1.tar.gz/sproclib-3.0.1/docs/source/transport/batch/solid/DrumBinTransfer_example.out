=== DrumBinTransfer Example ===

1. Creating DrumBinTransfer instances:
----------------------------------------
Pharmaceutical transfer: PharmaPowderTransfer
  Container capacity: 0.3 m続
  Max transfer rate: 80.0 kg/min

Food ingredient transfer: FoodIngredientTransfer
  Container capacity: 1.5 m続
  Max transfer rate: 300.0 kg/min

2. Steady-state analysis:
-------------------------
Pharmaceutical transfer results:
  Full container, good flow:
    Transfer rate: 60.0 kg/min
    Batch time: 290.0 s

  Half full, moderate flow:
    Transfer rate: 57.6 kg/min
    Batch time: 203.8 s

  Low level, poor flow:
    Transfer rate: 46.8 kg/min
    Batch time: 133.1 s

  High setpoint, excellent flow:
    Transfer rate: 72.0 kg/min
    Batch time: 230.0 s

3. Dynamic simulation:
--------------------
Simulating batch transfer with pharma_transfer:
Initial conditions: rate=0 kg/min, fill=100%
Setpoint: 70.0 kg/min, flowability: 0.8

Dynamic simulation results:
  Final time: 182.0 s
  Final fill level: 0.000
  Average transfer rate: 59.8 kg/min

4. Flowability sensitivity analysis:
-----------------------------------
Food transfer flowability sensitivity (80% fill, 80 kg/min setpoint):
  Flowability 0.1: 80.0 kg/min
  Flowability 0.2: 80.0 kg/min
  Flowability 0.3: 80.0 kg/min
  Flowability 0.4: 80.0 kg/min
  Flowability 0.5: 80.0 kg/min
  Flowability 0.6: 80.0 kg/min
  Flowability 0.7: 80.0 kg/min
  Flowability 0.8: 80.0 kg/min
  Flowability 0.9: 80.0 kg/min
  Flowability 1.0: 80.0 kg/min

5. Model introspection:
--------------------

  discharge_efficiency: 0.9 - - Discharge mechanism efficiency
  handling_time: 90.0 s - Setup and handling time per batch

Operating ranges:
  container_capacity: 0.1 - 2.0
  transfer_rate_max: 10.0 - 500.0
  material_density: 200.0 - 2000.0
  discharge_efficiency: 0.5 - 1.0
  fill_level: 0.0 - 1.0
