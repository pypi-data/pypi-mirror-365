Reactor Metadata:
Type: SemiBatchReactor
Description: Semi-batch reactor with fed-batch operation and variable volume
Category: reactor

Algorithms:
  reaction_kinetics: Arrhenius equation: k = k0 * exp(-Ea/RT)
  material_balance: dnA/dt = F_in*CA_in - k(T)*CA*V
  volume_balance: dV/dt = F_in
  energy_balance: dT/dt = heat terms with variable volume

Applications:
  - Fed-batch processes
  - Controlled polymerization
  - Fine chemical production
  - Crystallization
  - Biochemical fermentation
