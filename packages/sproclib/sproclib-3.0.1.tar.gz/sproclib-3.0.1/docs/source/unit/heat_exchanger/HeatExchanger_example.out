  Design Flow: Effectiveness = 0.582, Q = 5.59 MW
  150% Flow: Effectiveness = 0.479, Q = 6.90 MW

Hot Inlet Temperature Sensitivity:
  450°C: Q = 14.33 MW
  460°C: Q = 14.68 MW
  470°C: Q = 15.02 MW
  480°C: Q = 15.37 MW
  490°C: Q = 15.72 MW

COMPARISON WITH HANDBOOK CORRELATIONS:

Tube Side Reynolds Number: 1528
Tube Side Prandtl Number: 75.0
Flow Regime: Laminar (unusual for industrial scale)

SCALE-UP CONSIDERATIONS:
Current Heat Duty: 5.6 MW
Heat Flux: 12423 W/m² (within typical range: 5,000-50,000 W/m²)
Area Density: 52.9 m²/m³ (shell side)
Clean Overall HTC (U_clean): 187 W/m²·K
Design U with Fouling: 180 W/m²·K
Fouling Margin: 3.6%

PERFORMANCE MONITORING RECOMMENDATIONS:
Key Process Variables to Monitor:
  • Inlet/Outlet temperatures (±2°C accuracy)
  • Flow rates (±5% accuracy)
  • Pressure drop across exchanger (<20 kPa typical)
  • Fouling rate (effectiveness degradation)

Maintenance Indicators:
  • Effectiveness drop below 0.524 indicates fouling
  • LMTD increase above 82.8 K suggests performance degradation
