Process Models Overview
----------------------

**ControlValve**: Industrial control valve with flow coefficient characteristics for automated flow regulation. 
Typical applications include reactor cooling/heating systems, pressure regulation, level control, and emergency 
shutdown systems. Features linear, equal percentage, and quick opening characteristics with actuator dynamics.

**ThreeWayValve**: Three-way valve for flow mixing or diverting applications enabling proportional flow distribution. 
Used in temperature control via stream blending, product distribution systems, bypass control, and heat exchanger 
applications.

Unit Operations Context
----------------------

These valve models fit into chemical plant operations as:

- **Flow Control**: Primary elements in flow control loops for reactor feeds, product streams, and utility systems
- **Temperature Control**: Mixing valves for hot/cold stream blending and diverting valves for bypass temperature control  
- **Pressure Regulation**: Control valves for maintaining downstream pressures in distribution systems
- **Safety Systems**: Emergency shutdown valves and pressure relief applications
- **Process Optimization**: Flow splitting for parallel processing units and product grade transitions

Valve models implement standard ISA equations and characteristics used throughout the chemical process industry 
for accurate flow control and process automation.
