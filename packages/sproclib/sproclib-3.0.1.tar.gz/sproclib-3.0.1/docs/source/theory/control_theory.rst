Control Theory
==============

Theoretical foundations of control systems used in SPROCLIB.

Overview
--------

This section provides the theoretical background for understanding and applying
control systems within SPROCLIB.

.. note::
   This section is currently under development. Complete theoretical
   coverage will be available in a future release.
