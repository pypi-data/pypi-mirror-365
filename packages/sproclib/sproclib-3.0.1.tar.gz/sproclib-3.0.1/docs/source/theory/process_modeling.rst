Process Modeling
================

Theoretical foundations of process modeling in SPROCLIB.

Overview
--------

This section covers the theoretical aspects of process modeling and simulation
as implemented in SPROCLIB.

.. note::
   This section is currently under development. Complete theoretical
   foundations will be available in a future release.
