Overview
--------

The theory section covers:

* **Theory** - General process control theory and concepts
* **Mathematical Foundations** - Mathematical background for control systems
* **Control Theory** - Advanced control theory topics
* **Process Modeling** - Principles of chemical process modeling

These documents provide the academic and theoretical context for the practical implementations available in the SPROCLIB library.
