State-Space Controllers
=======================

State-space control methods for multivariable process control.

Overview
--------

This section covers state-space control approaches for multivariable systems
where traditional single-loop control is insufficient.

.. note::
   This section is currently under development. Complete implementation details
   will be available in a future release.

Available Controllers
--------------------

**State-Space Controller**
   Linear state-space control for MIMO systems.

**Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)**
   Optimal state feedback control (planned).

**Kalman Filter Integration**
   State estimation for unmeasured states (planned).

Applications
-----------

State-space controllers are ideal for:

* Multivariable processes (MIMO systems)
* Systems with strong coupling between variables
* Processes requiring optimal performance
* Applications with unmeasured state variables

Selection Guidelines
-------------------

Choose state-space control when:

* System has multiple inputs and outputs
* Strong interactions exist between control loops
* State estimation is required
* Optimal control performance is needed
