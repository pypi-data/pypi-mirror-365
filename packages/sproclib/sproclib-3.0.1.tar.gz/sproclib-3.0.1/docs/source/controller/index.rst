Controller Types Overview
-------------------------

**PID Controller**: Three-term feedback controller for single-loop applications.
Standard workhorse for temperature, flow, pressure, and level control in chemical processes.
Simple tuning with well-established methods (Ziegler-Nichols, Cohen-Coon, Lambda tuning).

**State-Space Controller**: Multivariable controller using modern control theory.
Optimal for MIMO systems like distillation columns, reactor networks, and heat exchanger 
networks where process interactions are significant.

**IMC Controller**: Model-based controller with systematic design procedure.
Single tuning parameter (filter time constant) provides robust performance for 
well-modeled SISO processes with known dynamics.

Unit Operations Context
----------------------

Control systems are essential for:

- **Reaction Engineering**: Temperature, pressure, and composition control in reactors
- **Separation Processes**: Product quality control in distillation, extraction, absorption
- **Heat Transfer**: Temperature control in heat exchangers, furnaces, crystallizers
- **Fluid Mechanics**: Flow and pressure control in pumping and piping systems
- **Mass Transfer**: Composition control in absorption, stripping, membrane processes

Control Strategy Selection
-------------------------

**Use PID for**:
- Single-input single-output loops
- Well-established applications (temperature, flow, level)
- Simple commissioning requirements
- Operator familiarity important

**Use State-Space for**:
- Multiple-input multiple-output systems
- Strong process interactions
- Optimal performance requirements
- Complex batch processes

**Use IMC for**:
- Well-modeled processes
- Systematic tuning approach needed
- Robust performance critical
- Model-based design philosophy preferred

Performance Specifications
--------------------------

**Typical Control Objectives**:
- Settling time: 2-4 process time constants
- Overshoot: <5-10% for most applications
- Steady-state error: <1% for regulatory control
- Disturbance rejection: <5% deviation from setpoint

**Economic Impact**:
- Energy savings: 5-15% with proper control
- Product quality improvement: 2-8%
- Reduced variability: 20-50%
- Decreased operator intervention: 60-80%
