Model-Based Controllers
=======================

Advanced model-based control algorithms for process control.

Overview
--------

This section covers model-based control approaches that utilize explicit
process models to design high-performance controllers.

.. note::
   This section is currently under development. Complete implementation details
   will be available in a future release.

Available Controllers
--------------------

**Internal Model Control (IMC)**
   Model-based control using internal process models for robust performance.

**Model Predictive Control (MPC)**
   Advanced control for multivariable systems with constraints (planned).

**Linear Quadratic Control (LQR)**  
   Optimal control for linear systems (planned).

Applications
-----------

Model-based controllers are ideal for:

* Complex multivariable processes
* Processes with known time delays
* Systems requiring optimal performance
* Applications where robustness is critical

Selection Guidelines
-------------------

Choose model-based control when:

* Accurate process model is available
* Superior performance is required compared to PID
* Process has significant interactions
* Economic optimization is important
