IMCController
=============

Internal Model Control (IMC) implementation for process control.

Overview
--------

.. note::
   This section is currently under development. Complete implementation details
   will be available in a future release.

The IMCController provides internal model control capabilities for chemical
process control applications where a process model is available.

Theory
------

Internal Model Control (IMC) is a model-based control strategy that uses an
explicit process model to design the controller.

Implementation
--------------

.. code-block:: python

   # Implementation details coming soon
   from sproclib.controller.model_based import IMCController
   
   # Basic usage example will be provided
   pass

Features
--------

* Model-based control design
* Robust performance characteristics  
* Disturbance rejection capabilities
* Tuning parameter simplification

Applications
-----------

Suitable for processes where:

* Accurate process model is available
* Robust performance is required
* Model uncertainties exist
* Disturbance rejection is important
