Transport Systems Overview
==========================

This section provides a comprehensive guide to modeling transport systems in SPROCLIB.
Transport systems are fundamental components in process engineering, responsible for moving
materials, energy, and information throughout chemical processes.

.. note::
   Transport modeling in SPROCLIB combines rigorous physics-based approaches with practical
   engineering considerations for real-world applications.

What are Transport Systems?
---------------------------

Transport systems encompass all mechanisms for moving materials and energy in chemical processes:

**Material Transport:**
- Fluid flow through pipelines and equipment
- Solid particle transport in pneumatic and slurry systems
- Multiphase flow involving gas-liquid or solid-liquid mixtures
- Batch material handling and transfer operations

**Energy Transport:**
- Heat transfer in heat exchangers and thermal systems
- Mechanical energy transfer through pumps and compressors
- Electrical energy distribution for process equipment

**Information Transport:**
- Signal transmission in control systems
- Data communication networks
- Instrumentation and measurement systems

Transport Phenomena Fundamentals
--------------------------------

SPROCLIB transport models are based on fundamental transport phenomena principles:

Conservation Laws
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Mass Conservation (Continuity Equation):**

.. math::

   \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0

**Momentum Conservation (Navier-Stokes):**

.. math::

   \rho \frac{D\mathbf{v}}{Dt} = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \rho \mathbf{g}

**Energy Conservation:**

.. math::

   \rho c_p \frac{DT}{Dt} = k \nabla^2 T + \Phi

Where:
- :math:`\rho` = density
- :math:`\mathbf{v}` = velocity vector
- :math:`p` = pressure
- :math:`\mu` = viscosity
- :math:`T` = temperature
- :math:`\Phi` = viscous dissipation

Transport Categories in SPROCLIB
--------------------------------

Key Transport Parameters
-----------------------

Understanding these parameters is essential for effective transport modeling:

Flow Characteristics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Reynolds Number:**
Determines flow regime (laminar vs. turbulent)

.. math::

   Re = \frac{\rho v D}{\mu}

- Re < 2300: Laminar flow
- 2300 < Re < 4000: Transition region
- Re > 4000: Turbulent flow

**Friction Factor:**
Quantifies pressure loss due to wall friction

.. math::

   f = \frac{\Delta p}{\frac{L}{D} \frac{\rho v^2}{2}}

**Flow Velocity:**
Critical parameter for transport efficiency and equipment sizing

Fluid Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Density (ρ):** Mass per unit volume, affects momentum and pressure
**Viscosity (μ):** Resistance to flow, determines friction losses
**Surface Tension (σ):** Important for multiphase flow and droplet formation
**Compressibility:** Significant for gas flow and high-pressure liquids

System Geometry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Pipe Diameter:** Primary factor in pressure drop and flow capacity
**Length:** Determines total friction losses
**Roughness:** Surface condition affecting friction factor
**Elevation:** Hydrostatic pressure effects

Modeling Approach in SPROCLIB
-----------------------------

Physics-Based Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SPROCLIB transport models implement established engineering correlations:

**Pressure Drop Calculations:**
- Darcy-Weisbach equation for pipe friction

State Variables and Inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**State Variables (x):**
- Pressures, temperatures, concentrations
- Flow rates and velocities
- Accumulated quantities (volumes, masses)

**Input Variables (u):**
- Boundary conditions (inlet pressures, temperatures)
- Control actions (pump speeds, valve positions)
- Disturbances (ambient conditions, feed compositions)

**Output Variables (y):**

- Safety and environmental parameters

Practical Implementation
-----------------------

Model Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Choose the appropriate transport model based on your application:

**For Clean Liquid Transport:**
Use ``PipeFlow`` for water, chemicals, and other single-phase liquids

**For Precise Dosing:**
Use ``PeristalticFlow`` for accurate, contamination-free fluid delivery

**For Slurry Systems:**
Use ``SlurryPipeline`` for solid-liquid mixtures with settling considerations

Model Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Key considerations when setting up transport models:

**Geometric Parameters:**
- Accurate dimensions (length, diameter, elevation)
- Surface roughness appropriate for material and age
- Proper accounting of fittings and restrictions

**Fluid Properties:**
- Temperature-dependent properties when significant
- Appropriate correlations for non-Newtonian fluids
- Mixture properties for multiphase systems

**Operating Conditions:**
- Representative flow rates and pressures
- Normal and upset condition ranges
- Control system interactions

Integration with Process Models
------------------------------

Transport models integrate seamlessly with other SPROCLIB components:

    from simulation.process_simulation import ProcessSimulation
    
    # Create transport model
    pipeline = PipeFlow(pipe_length=1000, pipe_diameter=0.2)
    
    # Design flow controller
    process_params = pipeline.identify_parameters()
    pid_params = tune_pid(process_params, method='lambda_tuning')
    
    # Simulate closed-loop performance
    sim = ProcessSimulation(pipeline, controller=pid_params)
    results = sim.run(time_span=3600, disturbances=True)

Optimization Integration

    from transport.continuous.liquid import SlurryPipeline
    from optimization.parameter_estimation import optimize_parameters
    
    # Create slurry transport model
    slurry = SlurryPipeline(pipe_length=5000, pipe_diameter=0.3)
    
    # Optimize operating conditions
    def objective(params):
        velocity, concentration = params
        result = slurry.steady_state([400000, concentration, velocity])
        return result[0]  # Minimize pressure drop
    
    optimal_conditions = optimize_parameters(
        objective, 
        bounds=[(1.0, 4.0), (0.1, 0.3)],
        constraints={'velocity_ratio': 1.2}
    )

Best Practices

Model Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Always validate transport models against known data:

1. **Steady-State Validation:** Compare with hand calculations or literature
2. **Dynamic Validation:** Check transient response against expectations
3. **Sensitivity Analysis:** Verify reasonable parameter dependencies
4. **Limiting Cases:** Test extreme conditions for physical behavior

Performance Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Optimize computational efficiency:

1. **Model Complexity:** Use simplest model that captures essential physics
2. **Time Steps:** Choose appropriate integration steps for dynamics
3. **Convergence:** Monitor numerical solution convergence
4. **Parallel Processing:** Utilize vectorized operations where possible

Safety and Reliability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensure safe and reliable operation:

1. **Operating Envelopes:** Define safe operating boundaries
2. **Alarm Limits:** Set appropriate warning and critical limits
3. **Backup Systems:** Consider redundancy and fail-safe modes
4. **Maintenance:** Account for equipment degradation and maintenance
