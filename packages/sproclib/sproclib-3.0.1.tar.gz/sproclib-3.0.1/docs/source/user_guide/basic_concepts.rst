Basic Concepts
==============

This section introduces the fundamental concepts underlying transport system modeling in SPROCLIB.

Transport Phenomena Overview
----------------------------

Transport phenomena involve the movement of mass, momentum, and energy in chemical processes.
SPROCLIB implements physics-based models for these fundamental processes.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Conservation Laws** - Mass, momentum, and energy conservation
* **Constitutive Equations** - Material property relationships
* **Boundary Conditions** - System interfaces and constraints
* **State Variables** - Pressure, temperature, flow rate, concentration

Model Architecture
------------------

SPROCLIB transport models follow a consistent architecture:

**State-Space Representation:**

.. math::

   \\frac{dx}{dt} = f(t, x, u)

   y = g(t, x, u)

Where:
- :math:`x` = state vector (pressures, temperatures, concentrations)
- :math:`u` = input vector (boundary conditions, control actions)
- :math:`y` = output vector (measured variables)

**Steady-State Analysis:**

.. math::

   0 = f(x_{ss}, u_{ss})

   y_{ss} = g(x_{ss}, u_{ss})

Physical Property Models
-----------------------

Transport models require accurate physical property correlations:

**Fluid Density:**
- Temperature and pressure dependent
- Mixing rules for multicomponent systems

**Viscosity:**
- Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids
- Temperature and composition effects

**Heat Capacity:**
- Temperature dependent correlations
- Phase change considerations

Numerical Methods
-----------------

SPROCLIB employs robust numerical methods:

**ODE Integration:**
- Runge-Kutta methods for dynamic systems
- Adaptive time stepping for efficiency
- Stiff equation solvers when needed

**Nonlinear Equation Solving:**
- Newton-Raphson methods
- Trust region algorithms
- Robust initialization strategies
