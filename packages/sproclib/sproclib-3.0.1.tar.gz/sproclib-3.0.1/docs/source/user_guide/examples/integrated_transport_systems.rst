Integrated Transport Systems
============================

This section covers integrated transport system examples that combine multiple transport models.

Overview
--------

Integrated transport systems demonstrate how to combine different transport models within a 
single process configuration. These examples show real-world applications where multiple 
transport phenomena occur simultaneously.

Examples include:

* **Multi-stage Pipeline Systems** - Combining pipeline transport with pump systems
* **Process Integration** - Transport models within larger process control loops  
* **Complex Flow Networks** - Multiple interconnected transport pathways
* **Hybrid Systems** - Combinations of different transport mechanisms

Coming Soon
-----------

Detailed examples for integrated transport systems are currently being prepared and will be 
available in future documentation updates.
