Petrochemical Plant Control
==========================

Advanced control of a large-scale petrochemical distillation complex.

Overview
--------

This case study demonstrates the implementation of advanced process control in a
petrochemical plant, focusing on distillation column optimization and heat integration.

Problem Statement
----------------

.. note::
   This case study is currently under development. Complete implementation details
   will be available in a future release.

Key Challenges
--------------

* Multi-variable control of distillation columns
* Heat integration optimization
* Product quality consistency
* Energy consumption minimization

Solution Approach
----------------

The solution utilizes SPROCLIB's advanced control capabilities including:

* Model Predictive Control (MPC)
* Economic optimization
* Real-time parameter estimation
* Disturbance rejection

Implementation
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   # Placeholder for implementation
   from sproclib.unit.distillation import BinaryDistillationColumn
   from sproclib.controller.model_based import MPCController
   
   # Implementation details coming soon
   
Results
-------

Expected improvements:

* 15% reduction in energy consumption
* Improved product quality consistency
* Better disturbance rejection
* Enhanced operational flexibility
