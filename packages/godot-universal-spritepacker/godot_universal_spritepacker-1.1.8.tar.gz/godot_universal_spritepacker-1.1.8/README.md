## Description

**Godot Universal SpritePacker** is a Python tool that converts individual images, tilesets, and SVG layers into optimized spritesheets and ready-to-use Godot `.tres` resources:
* [AtlasTextures](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_atlastexture.html) for single sprites  
* [SpriteFrames](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_spriteframes.html) for animations

It intelligently splits, trims and packs images or vector layers into one or more texture atlases, preserving your folder structure and optionally generating [PixiJS-compatible](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/blob/main/packages/spritesheet/src/Spritesheet.ts) `.json` files or native Godot resources.

### Why?

I've used [TexturePacker](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker) for years and still think it’s a great option if you need the full range of features it provides. But over time, I realized I didn’t actually need most of them. I had already written custom importers for its metadata formats in my own [retro JavaScript games](https://donitz.itch.io/sweet-hell), and the actual task of packing sprites turned out to be straightforward thanks to the excellent [rectpack](https://github.com/secnot/rectpack) module.

This led me to build the first version of this tool (originally called `smart_splitter`), focused on a workflow where sprites and tilesets are kept as individual files and automatically packed into spritesheets based on their filename and folder structure. For example, an animated sprite called `player__32x32.png` would be treated as multiple sprites in one image. That setup made iteration super convenient. Later, as I started using Godot more, I extended the tool to export native `.tres` resources as well.

I also occasionally needed to export UI icons directly from vector files, making it easy to go from vector artwork to in-game assets. For example, I used a single SVG with this packer when creating the icons for [Canvas Draw 2D](https://donitz.itch.io/canvas-draw-2d), turning updates into a single-click task.

I hope this tool helps simplify your 2D asset workflow too!

## How it works

The tool follows these steps:

1. Scans the specified `source_directory` (and subdirectories) for images files (`'.png'`, `'.bmp'`, `'.jpg'`, `'.jpeg'`) and vector files (`.svg`).
2. Parses filenames to detect optional suffixes indicating tile size, frame rate, padding, etc.
3. Splits images into individual sprites based on the specified tile size.
   - If the file is an SVG, each **layer** is exported as a separate sprite using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
4. Optionally checks for the existence of a `.csv` file with multiple animation definitions for a single image.
5. Optionally saves individual sprite images to the `image_directory`.
6. Optionally trims transparent spaces from the sprites.
7. Packs sprites into one or more optimized spritesheets (texture atlases).
8. Generates metadata files:
   - (a) [PixiJS-compatible](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs/blob/main/packages/spritesheet/src/Spritesheet.ts) `.json`
   - (b) Godot 4 AtlasTexture `.tres` files
   - (c) Godot 4 SpriteFrames `.tres` files (for animations)

## File naming convention

Files should be named according to this pattern:

```
boss_turret__WxH[pN][fpsN][loop]
```

### Examples:

- `background.png` - Treats the entire image as one sprite.
- `hero__32x32.png` - Splits the image into multiple 32x32 sprites.
- `Small Spider__64x64p2fps12loop.png` - 64×64 sprite with 2px padding, 12 FPS animation, looping

| Field   | Description                                                 |
|:--------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`  | Sprite or animation name.                                   |
| `W x H` | Tile width × height in pixels.                              |
| `pN`    | (optional) Padding between tiles (e.g., `p2` = 2px).        |
| `fpsN`  | (optional) Frame rate in frames per second (e.g., `fps12`). |
| `loop`  | (optional) If present, marks the animation as looping.      |

If the source file is located inside a subfolder, the relative path is included in the sprite's name (e.g., `enemies/boss__64x64.png`).

Sprites are named using the format `subfolder_a/subfolder_b/original_name__RxC`, where `R` is the row index and `C` is the column index. Rows and columns are intentionally inverted from standard grid notation so that alphabetical sorting orders sprites left to right.

> **Note:** SVG files are always exported as individual sprites based on layer and the pixel resolution defined in the file. The filename is ignored.

---

## Animation metadata (CSV)

You can define multiple animations using a `.csv` file with the same base name as the image. When present, the CSV defines all frames for the corresponding `SpriteFrames` resource, and any unused sprites from the original image are discarded.

Animation data is also saved in the `.json` spritesheet file as both `animations` (recognised by `PixiJS`) and in the `meta` field. The animation name is `image_name:animation_name`. When multiple spritesheets are exported, all animation data is stored within each individual spritesheet.

### Example: `hero.csv`
```
name; start_x; start_y; count_x; count_y; fps; loop
Walk;       0;       0;       4;       1;  12; true
Jump;       0;       1;       4;       1;  12; false
```

| Field     | Description                                         |
|:----------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| `name`    | Animation name (as seen in Godot).                  |
| `start_x` | Starting tile column.                               |
| `start_y` | Starting tile row.                                  |
| `count_x` | Number of columns in the animation.                 |
| `count_y` | Number of rows in the animation.                    |
| `fps`     | Playback speed (frames per second).                 |
| `loop`    | Whether the animation should loop (`true`/`false`). |

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (optional, for SVG layer processing)
  If Inkscape is not installed at the default path, set it manually using `--inkscape_path`.
- Requires the Pillow and [rectpack](https://github.com/secnot/rectpack) modules.

## Installation

You can install the tool from PyPI or directly from GitHub. This installs a command-line tool called `godot_universal_spritepacker`:

```bash
pip install godot-universal-spritepacker
```

or

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Donitzo/godot-universal-spritepacker.git
```

Alternatively, you can simply download the script and run it directly:

```bash
python src/godot_universal_spritepacker/godot_universal_spritepacker.py
```

## Demo

There is a set of sprites in the `sample` directory. Try converting them using one of the two `.bat` files to get an idea how the tool works. One of the files generates multiple spritesheets.

Inside the pre-made `./sample/output` directory, there is a simple `PixiJS` demo page for rendering the contents of the pre-compiled spritesheet. To test the PixiJS demo locally, serve it using a simple HTTP server.
