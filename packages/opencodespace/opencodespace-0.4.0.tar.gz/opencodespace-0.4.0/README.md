## üõ† Requirements

### For Local Development
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Docker** - [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

### For Fly.io Deployment  
- **Python 3.7+**
- **flyctl** - [Install flyctl](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/)

### For Editor Configuration Sync
- **VS Code** and/or **Cursor** installed locally (optional)
- Extensions accessible via `code --list-extensions` or `cursor --list-extensions`

---

## üéØ Usage Scenarios

### üè† Local Development with Editor Sync

Perfect for testing with your complete development setup:

```bash
# Interactive setup with editor detection
opencodespace

# Manual configuration for local platform
opencodespace deploy --platform local
```

Your remote environment will have:
- ‚úÖ All your installed extensions  
- ‚úÖ Your settings.json configuration
- ‚úÖ Your themes and preferences
- ‚úÖ Language-specific settings

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Development with Full Setup

Deploy to Fly.io with your complete editor configuration:

```bash
# Interactive setup for cloud deployment
opencodespace

# Configure platform during setup
> Select platform: fly.io

# Access your fully configured environment
# at https://your-app.fly.dev
```

### ü§ñ AI Development Environment

Pre-configured with AI tools, automatic password generation, and your editor setup:

```bash
# Full setup with AI tools and editor config
opencodespace

# During interactive setup, you'll configure:
# - Secure auto-generated VS Code password
# - VS Code/Cursor settings & extensions  
# - AI API keys (Anthropic, Gemini, OpenAI)
# - Git repository access
# - SSH keys for private repos
```

Your environment will include:
- ‚úÖ **Secure Access**: Auto-generated password for VS Code/Coder
- ‚úÖ **AI Integration**: API keys available as environment variables
- ‚úÖ **Complete Setup**: Your editor preferences and extensions

### üîí Private Repositories with Editor Sync

Secure access to private repos with your development environment:

```bash
# Interactive setup handles everything
opencodespace

# Setup wizard will:
# 1. Detect your editors
# 2. Offer to copy settings/extensions
# 3. Configure SSH keys for Git access
# 4. Set up repository cloning
```

### üöÄ Team Development Environments

Share consistent development environments:

```bash
# Each team member gets the same setup
opencodespace

# Everyone can optionally overlay their own:
# - Editor preferences  
# - Extension sets
# - Personal settings
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Secure Access

- **Auto-Generated Passwords**: VS Code/Coder passwords are automatically generated during setup
- **Password Storage**: Passwords are saved in your `.opencodespace/config.toml` for reference
- **Password Display**: The password is displayed prominently during setup and after deployment

### AI API Keys Configuration

- **Structured Setup**: AI API keys are now configured in the dedicated `[ai_api_keys]` section
- **Environment Variables**: Keys are automatically available as environment variables in your container
- **Supported Services**: Anthropic (Claude), Google Gemini, and OpenAI (ChatGPT)
- **Optional Configuration**: All AI API keys are optional and can be configured later

### Editor Configuration

- **Interactive Mode**: Editor detection and configuration only happens during interactive setup
- **Non-Interactive Mode**: Use `opencodespace -y` to skip editor configuration for CI/CD
- **Multiple Editors**: If both VS Code and Cursor are detected, you can choose to copy from both
- **Extension Compatibility**: Cursor extensions are compatible with VS Code and will be installed

### Empty Workspace Warning

When both SSH key and folder upload are disabled:

```bash
‚ö†Ô∏è  Warning: No SSH key provided and folder upload disabled.
   The container will start with an empty workspace and no git access.
   Consider enabling folder upload or providing an SSH key for git operations.
```

### Container Names

- **Local**: `opencodespace-{name}`
- **Fly.io**: Uses the app name directly

### Package Structure

```
opencodespace/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/opencodespace/           # Modern src layout
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                  # CLI with editor detection
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ providers/               # Platform providers
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .opencodespace/         # Docker templates with editor setup

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                   # This file
```

### AI API Keys Configuration

During interactive setup, you can configure AI API keys for popular services:

- **Anthropic (Claude)**: For Claude AI development assistance
- **Google Gemini**: For Google's Gemini AI models
- **OpenAI (ChatGPT)**: For OpenAI's GPT models

These keys are securely stored in your config and available as environment variables in your development environment, making it easy to use AI tools directly in your code.

## üî® Development & Building

This project includes a comprehensive build system with multiple interfaces for development tasks.

### Quick Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devadutta/opencodespace.git
cd opencodespace

# or: ./build.sh install

# Run quick tests during development
make test-quick
# or: python dev-build.py test --quick
# or: ./build.sh test-quick
```

### Build System Overview

Three equivalent interfaces for development tasks:

- **`python dev-build.py [command]`** - Feature-rich Python script (cross-platform)
- **`make [target]`** - Traditional Makefile interface (Unix/Linux)
- **`./build.sh [command]`** - Simple shell script wrapper

### Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `install` | Install dependencies and package in development mode |
| `test` | Run the complete test suite |
| `test-quick` | Run quick tests (recommended for development) |
| `clean` | Clean build artifacts and cache files |
| `build` | Build package for distribution |
| `lint` | Run code quality checks |
| `all` | Run complete build pipeline |

### Examples

```bash
# Development workflow
make install          # Set up development environment
make test-quick      # Test your changes
make all            # Full build pipeline before PR

# Building for distribution
make clean
make build
