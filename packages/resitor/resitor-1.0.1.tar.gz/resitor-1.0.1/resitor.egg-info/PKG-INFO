# resitor

`resitor` is a package to graphically monitor per-process resource usage.

While many systems have built-in functionality for graphical analysis, it only is available for system-wide usage. Users cannot analyze individual resource usage with other tools.

## Features

- graphical per-process monitoring of CPU and memory
- last-frame saving
- customization
- multiple PIDs
- CLI or Python

## Research Usage

With the increasing usage of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and generally computationally expensive tools, it is more important than ever to monitor different processes for overall efficiency. `resitor` introduces a new perspective with a visual graph of individual processes. Its `CLI` allows full integration for any process, extending its capabilities past `Python`. The novelty of `resitor` is its independant graph where users are able to interactively identify when a problem happens--as opposed to retrospective analysis found in other software. The closest software that allows users to visualize memory usage is `memory_profiler`, but it only generates a plot after the data is collected. Others that show live memory usage by-process include the built-in `top`, but it lacks visualization.

## Installation

To install resitor, use pip: ```pip install resitor```.

However, many prefer to use a virtual environment.

macOS / Linux:

```sh
# make your desired directory
mkdir /path/to/your/directory
cd /path/to/your/directory

# setup the .venv (or whatever you want to name it)
pip install virtualenv
python3 -m venv .venv

# install resitor
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install resitor

deactivate # when you are completely done
```

Windows CMD:

```sh
# make your desired directory
mkdir C:path\to\your\directory
cd C:path\to\your\directory

# setup the .venv (or whatever you want to name it)
pip install virtualenv
python3 -m venv .venv

# install resitor
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install resitor

deactivate # when you are completely done
```

## Usage

First, start a process (a python script). In the `Tests/` folder, there is an existing `long_program.py` (be careful, it takes resources so you must manually end it when you are done).

It will print the `PID` of that process, through `os.getpid()`. Then, use `python3 -m resitor <pid>` to monitor the resource usage.

Or, you may use the `start_monitor(<pid>, ...)` function and input your desired parameters.

You may enter a list of `PIDs` through `python3 -m resitor <pid1> <pid2> ...`. A list of PIDs can be inputed to `start_monitor()` as well.

If you don't want to watch CPU or memory, simply add the `-noc` or `nom` flags.

For Windows / Linux users, you may also watch the disk usage through the `-dsk` flag.

## Limitations

Currently, `psutil` (what this is built on) does not have per-process network monitoring.

Furthermore, macOS users do not have access to per-process disk monitoring.

CPU granularity is only limited to 1 / 10th of a percent.
