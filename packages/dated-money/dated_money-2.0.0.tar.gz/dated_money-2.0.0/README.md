# `dated-money`

A Python library for manipulating monetary values with control over the date on which currency conversions take place. It represents each monetary value as an amount (stored as a Decimal in cents) and a currency, along with a corresponding date.

## Motivation

If you're handling multi-currency transactions, you need to know not just "how much" but also "when" - because exchange rates change daily. This is critical for:

- **Businesses receiving payments in multiple currencies**: Track the exact value received on the date of transaction
- **Accurate financial reporting**: Use historical exchange rates for past transactions
- **Multi-currency portfolios**: Keep amounts in their original currency until you decide to convert

For example, if you receive ฿5000 (Thai Baht) on January 15th and it's immediately converted to €130, you need to record both the original amount AND the historical rate used. That's what `dated-money` does.

## Key Features

- **Date-aware currency conversion**: Perform accurate conversions based on historical exchange rates
- **Multiple rate sources**: Supports local repositories, Supabase, and exchangerate-api.com
- **Automatic rate fallback**: If rates aren't available for a specific date, automatically searches up to 10 days back
- **Type-safe**: Comprehensive type hints throughout the codebase


## Features

- Perform arithmetic operations on monetary values with different currencies and dates
- Convert monetary values between currencies based on exchange rates for specific dates
- Fetch and cache exchange rates from external APIs or local repositories
- Flexible configuration through environment variables

## Installation

You can install `dated-money` using uv (recommended):

```bash
uv add dated-money
```

or pip:

```bash
pip install dated-money
```

### Development Installation

For development, clone the repository and install with development dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juanre/dated-money
cd dated-money
uv sync
```

## Usage

### Example

Imagine you run a European company receiving payments in multiple currencies:

```python
from dated_money import Money, Currency

# Your company's base currency
CompanyMoney = Money(Currency.EUR)

# Payment received in Thai Baht (immediately converted to EUR)
thb_payment = CompanyMoney(5000, 'THB', on_date='2024-01-15')
print(thb_payment)  # Shows in original currency: ฿5000.00
print(thb_payment.to('EUR'))  # Shows in EUR: €130.52

# Payment received in USD (kept in USD account)
usd_payment = CompanyMoney(1000, 'USD', on_date='2024-01-15')
print(usd_payment)
# Output: $1000.00

# Calculate total revenue in EUR
total = thb_payment + usd_payment
print(f"Total revenue: {total}")
# Output: Total revenue: €1051.90
```

### More Examples

```python
from decimal import Decimal as Dec
from dated_money import Money, Currency

# Create a Money class with EUR as the base currency and conversion rates from a specific date
date_a = '2022-07-14'
Eur = Money(Currency.EUR, date_a)

# Create a Money class with AUD as the base currency and conversion rates from the same date
Aud = Money(base_currency='A$', base_date=date_a)

# Create monetary values in different currencies
price_eur = Eur(100)  # €100
price_usd = Eur(120, Currency.USD)  # $120
price_gbp = Eur(80, '£')  # £80

# Values are stored in cents and can be accessed in any currency
assert Eur(23, '€').cents('eur') == 2300
assert Eur(40).cents('usd') == Dec('4020.100502512562832012897042')

# Values can be created in any currency, regardless of the base currency
assert Eur(20, '£') == Aud(20, '£')

# Perform arithmetic operations
total = price_eur + price_usd + price_gbp
assert str(total) == '€270.40'  # Total in the base currency (EUR)

# Convert to a specific currency
total_usd = total.to(Currency.USD)
assert str(total_usd) == '$303.89'

# Compare monetary values
assert price_eur < price_usd
assert price_gbp == Eur(80, Currency.GBP)
```

### Operations with Different Currencies and Dates

You can perform operations on monetary values with different currencies and conversion dates:

```python
date_a = '2022-07-14'
date_b = '2022-01-07'

Eur = Money(Currency.EUR, date_a)
OldEur = Money('€', date_b)
Aud = Money(Currency.AUD, date_a)

# Operations between instances with different dates return an instance with the base date of the first element
adds = OldEur(10) + Eur(30)
assert adds.amount() == 40
assert adds.on_date == OldEur.base_date

# Operations between instances with different currencies return a result in the base currency
result = Eur(10, '$') + Eur(20, 'CAD')
assert result.currency == Currency.EUR

# Changing the reference dates affects the operation results
assert Eur(10, '$', date_a) + Eur(20, 'CAD', date_a) != Eur(10, '$', date_b) + Eur(20, 'CAD', date_b)

# Perform various arithmetic operations
assert Aud(10) + Eur(20) == Aud(39.70) == Eur(39.7, 'aud')
assert Eur(20) + Aud(10) == Eur(26.73)
assert (Aud(10) + Eur(20)).currency == Currency.AUD
assert (Eur(20) + Aud(10)).currency == Currency.EUR
assert Eur(20, 'aud') + Eur(20, 'gbp') == Aud(20, 'aud') + Aud(20, 'gbp')
```

### Using a Single Money Class

**Note**: `Money()` is a factory that returns a *class*, not an instance. You use it to create a customized Money class for your base currency, then create instances from that class.

In normal use, you will probably create a single Money class with your preferred base currency and use it to handle monetary values in various currencies:

```python
Eur = Money(Currency.EUR)

price_eur = Eur(100)  # €100
price_usd = Eur(120, Currency.USD)  # $120
price_gbp = Eur(80, '£')  # £80

total = price_eur + price_usd + price_gbp
assert str(total) == '€304.71'  # Total in the base currency (EUR)

assert price_usd.currency == Currency.USD
assert price_gbp.currency == Currency.GBP
```

### Configuring Exchange Rates

`dated-money` supports multiple sources for exchange rates, checked in this order:

1. **Local SQLite cache** (fastest)
2. **Local git repository** (for offline use)
3. **Supabase** (for shared team rates)
4. **exchangerate-api.com** (for fresh rates)

#### Rate Fallback Behavior

If exchange rates are not available for the requested date, `dated-money` automatically searches for rates from previous dates, going back up to 10 days. This ensures that currency conversions work even on weekends or holidays when fresh rates might not be available. When fallback rates are used, a log message indicates which date's rates were actually used.

#### Environment Variables

- `DMON_RATES_CACHE`: Directory for the SQLite cache database (default: platform-specific cache directory - see below)

- `DMON_RATES_REPO`: Directory containing a git repository with exchange rates in a `money` subdirectory

- `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY`: Credentials for Supabase integration

- `DMON_EXCHANGERATE_API_KEY`: API key for exchangerate-api.com (required for historical rates on paid plans)

#### Rate File Format

Rate files should be named `yyyy-mm-dd-rates.json` and contain:


```
    {
     "conversion_rates":{
      "USD":1,
      "AED":3.6725,
      "AFN":71.3141,
    ...}
    }
```

### Cache Database Location

By default, the cache database is stored in platform-specific locations:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Caches/dated_money/exchange-rates.db`
- **Linux**: `~/.cache/dated_money/exchange-rates.db` (or `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/dated_money/exchange-rates.db`)
- **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\dated_money\cache\exchange-rates.db`

You can override this by setting the `DMON_RATES_CACHE` environment variable to your preferred directory.

### Creating the Cache Database

The cache database is created automatically when you first use the library. To manually create it or populate it with historical data:

1. Create the database cache table:
   ```
   dmon-rates --create-table
   ```

2. If you have a paid API key for https://exchangerate-api.com, you can populate your cache with historical data:

```
dmon-rates --fetch-rates 2021-10-10:2021-10-20
```

## Development

This project uses modern Python development tools:

- **uv** for package management
- **black** for code formatting
