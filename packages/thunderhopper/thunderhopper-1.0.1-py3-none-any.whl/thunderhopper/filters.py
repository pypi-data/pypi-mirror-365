    """ Applies a digital Butterworth filter in second-order sections format.
        Includes both the sosfilt() and sosfiltfilt() function of scipy.signal.
        Data can be filtered once (forward) or twice (forward-backward, which
        doubles the order of the filter and centers the phase of the output).
        Provides low-pass, high-pass, and band-pass filter types.

        Forward filters by sosfilt() can be set to a given initial state to
        control the start value. Forward-backward filters by sosfiltfilt() can
        be used with all built-in and a custom padding method. The refilter
        argument can be used to switch between the two functions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ND array (any shape) of floats or ints
        Data to be filtered. Filter is applied along the specified time axis.
    rate : float or int
        Sampling rate of the time axis of data in Hz.
    cutoff : float or int or tuple (2,) of floats or ints
        Cut-off frequency of the applied filter in Hz. If mode is 'lp' or 'hp',
        must be a single value. If mode is 'bp', must be a tuple of two values.
    mode : str, optional
        Type of the applied filter. Options are 'lp' (low-pass), 'hp'
        (high-pass), and 'bp' (band-pass). The default is 'lp'.
    order : int, optional
        Order of the applied filter. If refilter is True, actual filter order
        is twice the specified order. The default is 1.
    axis : int, optional
        Time axis of data along which to apply the filter. The default is 0.
    refilter : bool, optional
        If True, uses the forward-backward filtering method of sosfiltfilt(),
        which enables use of padtype, padlen, and padval to control padding. If
        False, uses the forward filtering method of sosfilt(), which enables
        use of zi and init to control the start value. The default is True.
    padtype : str, optional
        Method used to pad the data before forward-backward filtering. Can be:
        # 'constant': Pads with first and last value of data, respectively.
        -> For signals with assessable endpoints (e.g. bound to some baseline).
        # 'even': Mirrors the data around each endpoint.
        -> For (noisy) signals whose statistics do not change much over time.
        # 'odd': Mirrors data, then turns it 180Â° around the endpoint.
        -> For oscillatory signals or where stable phase and smoothness is key.
        # 'fixed': Pads with padval (managed externally, not by scipy).
        -> For signals that are meant to be seen in a certain temporal context.
        # None: No padding.
        Ignored if refilter is False. The default is 'even'.
    padlen : int, optional
        Number of points added to each side of data. Applies for any padtype.
        Calculated by sosfiltfilt() as a very small number of points if None.
        Ignored if refilter is False or padtype is None or padtype is 'fixed'
        with padval being an array. If sanitize_padlen is True and padtype is
        a built-in method, may be reduced to avoid errors. The default is None.
    padval : float or int or ND array (any shape) of floats or ints, optional
        If specified and padtype is 'fixed', used as custom padding. If scalar,
        creates a constant padding of size padlen with the given value. If
        array, must have the same shape as data except along axis, so that it
        can be concatenated to data. Ignored if refilter is False or padtype is
        not 'fixed'. The default is 0.0.
    sanitize_padlen : bool, optional
        If True and padtype is a built-in method with padlen specified, clips
        padlen to be less than the size of the time axis of data, avoiding an
        internal sosfiltfilt() error. Ignored if refilter is False or padlen is
        None or padtype is 'fixed'. The default is True.
    zi : ND array of floats, optional
        If specified, sets the initial state for each second-order section of
        the applied forward filter, which in turn determines the start value(s)
        for filtering. Either returned by sosfilt() after a previous filtering
        step, or constructed manually. Shape must be (n_sections, ..., 2, ...),
        where n_sections equals sos.shape[0] and ..., 2, ... is the shape of
        data with data.shape[axis] replaced by 2. Use sosfilt_zi() to generate
        the initial state for a single section. If None, creates a filter state
        array of matching shape and adapts the inital state to the start value
        specified by init. Ignored if refilter is True. The default is None.
    init : float or int or ND array (any shape) of floats or ints, optional
        If specified and zi is None, adapts the initial filter state to this
        start values(s). If scalar, determines the start value for all filtered
        slices in data. If array, must have the same shape as data (except that
        init.shape[axis] must be 1) to set the start value for each slice. If
        None, uses the values of the first slice of data along axis. Ignored if
        refilter is True or zi is specified. The default is None.

    Returns
    -------
    filtered : ND array (data.shape) of floats

        Nyquist frequency (rate / 2), returns unchanged data. If mode is 'bp'
        and cutoff[1] is above Nyquist, falls back to pure high-pass filtering.
    next_state : ND array (zi.shape) of floats

        on with the next function call. Only returned if refilter is False.

    time : array of ints or floats, optional

#     """ Wrapper to gabor_function() to create Gabor kernels of a given type.
#         The desired kernel type is specified by its number of lobes and sign.
#         Generates one Gabor function for each Gaussian standard deviation in
#         sigmas and logs its relevant parameters. Frequency and phase of the
#         sinusoidal carrier are chosen to match the specified type. Features two
#         different methods of frequency estimation, time axis sharing, integral
#         normalization, and removal of unwanted outer kernel oscillations.

#     Parameters
#     ----------
#     sigmas : int or float or list or 1D array of ints or floats (m,)
#         Standard deviation of the Gaussian envelope in s. Always converted to
#         array format. Determines the number of created Gabor kernels. 
#     n_lobes : int or float
#         Number of lobes of the desired type of Gabor kernel. Odd numbers result
#         in mirror-symmetric Gabors, even numbers in point-symmetric Gabors.
#         Must be a positive integer number, although the type may be float.
#     sign : int or float
#         Sign, or vertical orientation, of the desired type of Gabor kernel.
#         Options are +1 (mirror-symmetric with positive central lobe, or point-
#         symmetric with a positive lobe left of the center) and -1 (mirror-
#         symmetric with negative central lobe, or point-symmetric with a
#         negative lobe left of the center). The default is 1.
#     rate : int or float, optional
#         Sampling rate of the Gabor kernels in Hz. If time is None, used to
#         generate the underlying time axes, else ignored. The default is 1000.
#     time : 1D array of ints or floats (n,), optional
#         Shared time axis underlying the Gabor kernels in s. Replaces rate if
#         specified, else calculated individually over [-5 * sigma, 5 * sigma]
#         for each kernel. The default is None.
#     normalize : bool, optional
#         If True, normalizes each created Gabor kernel by the integral over the
#         squared kernel, so that the dot product of the kernel function with
#         itself equals one. The default is False.
#     freq_kwargs : dict of ints or floats or 1D arrays (m,), optional
#         Modifies the frequency estimation method performed by gabor_freqs().
#         Specify any of 'peak_thresh' and 'offset' to change settings of the
#         linear approximation method (used by default). To switch to the width-
#         constrained method, either specify 'gauss_width' with precomputed width
#         estimates of the Gaussian envelopes, or specify 'rel_height' to let
#         gauss_width() compute them on the fly. All entries can be arrays of the
#         same length as sigmas. The default is {}. 
#     flat_flanks : bool, optional
#         If True and width-constrained frequency estimation method is used, sets
#         values of the Gabor kernels beyond the specified width of the Gaussian
#         envelope to zero, wiping outer oscillations. Ignored if freq_kwargs
#         contains neither 'gauss_width' nor 'rel_height'. The default is False.

#     Returns
#     -------
#     gabors : list (m,) of 1D arrays of floats
#         Gabor kernel of the desired type for each standard deviation in sigmas.
#         If time is specified, returns arrays of the same length.
#     times : list (m,) of 1D arrays of floats
#         Time axis underlying each Gabor kernel in s. If time is specified,
#         returns the same shared time axis for each kernel, else individual time
#         axes calculated over [-5 * sigma, 5 * sigma] with the given rate.
#     params : list (m,) of dicts of floats and ints
#         Dictionaries of parameters that characterize each created Gabor kernel
#         with keys 'sigma', 'freq', 'phase', 'lobes', and 'sign'. Includes the
#         standard deviation of the Gaussian envelope in s, the frequency of the
#         sinusoidal carrier in Hz and its phase shift in multiples of pi, as
