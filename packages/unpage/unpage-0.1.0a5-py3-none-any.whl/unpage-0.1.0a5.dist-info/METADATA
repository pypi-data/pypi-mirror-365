# Unpage

> [!WARNING]
> **ALPHA SOFTWARE**
> Unpage is experimental, under heavy development, and may be unstable. Use at your own risk!

Unpage is an infrastructure knowledge graph builder, and an MCP server to enable your LLM-powered application to understand and query your infrastructure.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- `uv` package manager
- API keys for your LLM and alerting, infrastructure, and observability tools. Learn more in [Plugins](https://docs.aptible.ai/concepts/plugins).

### Install uv

On macOS:
```shell
brew install uv
```

For other platforms, follow the [official uv installation guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

### Install Unpage

Unpage is designed to be run using `uvx`, which comes with `uv`:

```shell
uvx unpage -h
```

## Quickstart

To get started, run:

```shell
uvx unpage agent quickstart
```

This will get you up and running with your first agent, which will automatically investigate and add context to alerts from [PagerDuty](https://docs.aptible.ai/plugins/pagerduty) (or your preferred alerting provider). You will also have a chance to set up your infrastructure knowledge graph to provide your agent with more context.

The quickstart flow will walk you through:

- Configuring your LLM, PagerDuty plugin, and logs and metrics plugins
- Creating your first agent and prompt
- Testing your agent with an existing incident ticket
- Building your knowledge graph

### Running the Agent

Once you're happy with the results of your agent, you can automate the agent's actions for new incidents by running `unpage agent serve` and configuring [PagerDuty to send webhooks](https://docs.aptible.ai/plugins/pagerduty#webhooks) to the Unpage server:

```shell
uvx unpage agent serve -h
```

The `agent serve` command supports running the server over an ngrok tunnel, so that you can test your agents end-to-end locally, without deploying. For more information on `agent serve` options, see [its documentation](https://docs.aptible.ai/commands/agent#subcommand%3A-serve).
