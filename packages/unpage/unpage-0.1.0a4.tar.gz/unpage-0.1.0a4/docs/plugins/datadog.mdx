The [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) plugin provides access to the following
resources from your Datadog organization:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Knowledge Graph nodes" icon="diagram-project">
    - Services (from Software Catalog)
    - APIs (from Software Catalog)
    - Teams
    - Systems (inferred from relationships)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Prerequisites

You'll need a Datadog account with access to:

- **Datadog API**: An API key with appropriate permissions
- **Datadog Application Key**: An application key for accessing the Datadog APIs
- **Software Catalog**: Access to Datadog's Software Catalog feature (where services and APIs are defined)
- **Teams**: Access to Datadog Teams (if you want team relationship data)

The plugin uses Datadog's REST APIs to discover entities and their relationships.


## Configuration

Configure the Datadog plugin by running `uv run unpage configure` or by editing
the `~/.unpage/profiles/<profile_name>/config.yaml` file:

```yaml
plugins:
  # ...
  datadog:
    enabled: true
    api_key: "your-datadog-api-key"
    application_key: "your-datadog-application-key"
```

Alternatively, you can set these credentials as environment variables:

```bash
export DATADOG_API_KEY="your-datadog-api-key"
export DATADOG_APP_KEY="your-datadog-application-key"
```

The plugin will automatically use environment variables if no credentials are specified in the configuration file.
