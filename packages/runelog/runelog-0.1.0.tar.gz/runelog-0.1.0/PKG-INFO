## Lightweight ML Tracker

A simple, file-based Python library for tracking machine learning experiments, inspired by MLflow.

**RuneLog is in active development**. The core API is functional but subject to change.

The name *RuneLog* is a play on words. It evokes the common `run.log()` command used to log an experiment in tracking systems, while also treating these powerful, and sometimes mysterious, models as modern-day mystical writings: a "log of runes".


##  Why Runelog?

- **Zero-Overhead Setup**: start tracking runs in a single line
- **Local-First, Lightweight**: perfect for solo devs or small teams
- **Portable & Transparent**: data is stored in simple folders/files

##  Installation

### User Setup

This is the recommended way to install `runelog` if you just want to use it in your projects.

1. Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. Install the library from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install runelog
```

That's it! You can now import it into your Python scripts.

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gonz4lex/runelog.git
cd runelog
```
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Quickstart

Start tracking your ML experiments in just a few lines of code:

```python
from runelog import get_tracker

# 1. Initialize the tracker
tracker = get_tracker()

# 2. Get or create an experiment and start a run
with tracker.start_run(experiment_name="my-first-experiment"):
    
    # 3. Your training code and logging calls go here
    tracker.log_metric("accuracy", 0.95)
```

Check the detailed [Quickstart Guide](./docs/quickstart.md) for for a complete runnable example.

#### Usage Examples
You can find example scripts in the `examples/ directory`:

`train_model.py`

Full pipeline example with:
* logging parameters and metrics
* saving and registering models
* tagging and retrieving models

Run it:

```bash
python examples/train_model.py
```

`minimal_tracking.py`

Minimal working example with only metric logging.

Run it:

```bash
python examples/minimal_tracking.py
```

### Features
- ‚úÖ **Core Tracking API**: Experiments, runs, parameters, metrics.
- ‚úÖ **Artifact Logging**: Save model files, plots, and other artifacts.
- ‚úÖ **Model Registry**: Version and tag models.
- ‚úÖ **Streamlit UI**: Interactive dashboard to explore runs and the registry.
- üîÑ **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: For programmatic interaction.
- üîÑ **Full Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests.


### üê≥ Running the UI with Docker

The easiest way to run the Runelog web UI without setting up a local Python environment is with Docker. You must have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running.

#### Instructions

1.  Build the Docker image from the root of the project directory:
    ```bash
    docker build -t runelog-app .
    ```

2.  Use `docker-compose` to start the application:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

3.  To access the UI, open your web browser and navigate to:
    **[http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)**

4.  To stop the application, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal, and then run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```
