# Security Policy

This document outlines our procedures for reporting vulnerabilities and the security practices for **divine-typed-requests**.

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain only the latest released version. Please upgrade to the newest release to receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue, please contact us before disclosing it publicly.

- Create a [security advisory](https://github.com/divinescreener/typed-requests/security/advisories) on GitHub.
- Or email **security@divine.sh** (PGP available on request).

We aim to respond within **3 business days**. During this time please keep the details confidential. We will work with you to validate and address the issue as quickly as possible.

## Security Practices

The project uses GitHub's security features:

- **Dependabot** for dependency updates and vulnerability alerts.
- **CodeQL** analysis and static scans on every push.
- **Bandit**, **Safety**, and **Trivy** scans during CI workflows.

## Disclosure Policy

We request a 90‑day period to remediate validated vulnerabilities before any public disclosure. After a fix is released we will credit you in the release notes if desired.

## Thank You

We appreciate the community's help in keeping this project secure.
