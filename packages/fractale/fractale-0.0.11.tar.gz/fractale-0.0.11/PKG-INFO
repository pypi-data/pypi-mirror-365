> Translation layer for a jobspec specification to cluster execution

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/fractale.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/fractale)
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/773568660.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13787066)

This library is primarily being used for development for the descriptive thrust of the Fractale project. It is called fractale, but also not called fractale. You can't be sure of the name until you open the box.

## Design

### Simple

We provide a simple translation layer between job specifications. We take the assumption that although each manager has many options, the actual options a user would use is a much smaller set, and it's relatively straight forward to translate (and have better accuracy).

See [examples/transform](examples/transform) for an example.

### Complex

We want to:

1. Generate software graphs for some cluster (fluxion JGF) (this is done with [compspec](https://github.com/compspec/compspec)
2. Register N clusters to a tool (should be written as a python module)
3. Tool would have ability to select clusters from resources known, return
4. Need graphical representation (json) of each cluster - this will be used with the LLM inference

See [examples/fractale](examples/fractale) for a detailed walk-through of the above.

For graph tool:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge graph-tool
```

## Questions

- Should other subsystem types have edges? How used?
- Should we try to map them to nodes in the graph or use another means (or assume global across cluster nodes as we do now)?
- Can we simplify spack subsystem graph (it's really big...)
