# NOTE: Some import statements are intentionally written as alias imports, i.e.
#       `import package.subpackage as subpackage`
#       This is necessary for subpackages for which no stubs have been created yet.
#       -> For these imports, DO NOT CHANGE the import statements to `from package import subpackage`.
#       Once stubs for these subpackages are created, the import statements can
#       be changed to their respective `from package import subpackage` form.

# Import of subpackages for which _no_ stubs have been created yet:
import plotly.graph_objs.barpolar.hoverlabel as hoverlabel  # no stub created yet
import plotly.graph_objs.barpolar.legendgrouptitle as legendgrouptitle  # no stub created yet
import plotly.graph_objs.barpolar.marker as marker  # no stub created yet
import plotly.graph_objs.barpolar.selected as selected  # no stub created yet
import plotly.graph_objs.barpolar.unselected as unselected  # no stub created yet

# Import of subpackages for which stubs have been created:
# -/-

# Direct import of names this subpackage exports:

from plotly.graph_objs.barpolar._selected import Selected
