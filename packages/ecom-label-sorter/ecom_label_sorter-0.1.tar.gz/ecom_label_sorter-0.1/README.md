## Description:
A python program to sort Amazon pdf shipping labels.
Each sorted group of orders will be stored in a dedicated pdf file which is named after the product name and quantity.
On Miscellaneous orders these pdf file will be named "Mixed".
All of these files will be stored inside a folder which is named after the input pdf file.

## Reason to develop this project
Each order in the PDF consists of two pages: the first page is the shipping label, and the second page is the invoice.
Manually sorting a large PDF containing multiple orders is time-consuming and prone to human error.
