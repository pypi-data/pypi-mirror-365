`ipybox` is a lightweight and secure Python code execution sandbox based on [IPython](https://ipython.org/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). You can run it locally on your computer or remotely in an environment of your choice - no API key required.

While optimized for AI agents that interact with their environment through code execution, such as [`freeact`](https://github.com/gradion-ai/freeact/) agents, `ipybox` also serves as a general-purpose sandbox for secure code execution. It is fully open-source and distributed under the Apache 2.0 license.

- Stateful code execution with IPython kernels
- Stream code execution output as it is generated
- Install Python packages at build time or runtime
- Return plots generated with visualization libraries
- [Invocation of MCP servers](https://gradion-ai.github.io/ipybox/usage/#mcp-integration) via generated client code
- Flexible deployment options, local or remote
- `asyncio` API for managing the execution environment

## Quickstart

Install `ipybox` Python package:

```bash
pip install ipybox
```

Execute Python code in an `ipybox` container:

```python
import asyncio
from ipybox import ExecutionClient, ExecutionContainer

async def main():
    async with ExecutionContainer(tag="ghcr.io/gradion-ai/ipybox:minimal") as container:
        async with ExecutionClient(port=container.executor_port) as client:
            result = await client.execute("print('Hello, world!')")
            print(f"Output: {result.text}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
