    Takes the output from cost_export() _(i.e. depends handle by main)_

    The CSV will contain the time period, and associated costs.

    Args:
        cm_client_query_results (list): List of cost data dictionaries as returned
            by cost_export(). Each dictionary should contain:
            - time_period (dict): date as string.
            - COST (str): Cost amount as string.
            
        filename (str, optional): Output filename for the CSV. Defaults to 'az_cost_report.csv'.

    Returns:
        None: Writes directly to file but doesn't return any value.
