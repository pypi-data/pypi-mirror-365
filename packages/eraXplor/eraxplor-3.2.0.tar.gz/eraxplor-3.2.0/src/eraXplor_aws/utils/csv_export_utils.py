    """Exports AWS cost data to a CSV file with standardized formatting.

    Takes the output from monthly_account_cost_export() _(i.e. depends handle by main)_
    and writes it to a CSV file with consistent column headers and proper formatting.
    The CSV will contain the time period, Account/Service/Purchase_type/Usage_type,
    and associated costs.

    Args:
        fetch_monthly_account_cost_usage (list): List of cost data dictionaries as returned
            by monthly_account_cost_export(). Each dictionary should contain:
            - time_period (dict): With 'Start' and 'End' keys
            - ID : AWS account ID, service name, purchase type name, usage type name.
            - GROUPBY_FILTER (str): Grouping filter used in the query, e.g., 'Account', 'Service', etc.
            - COST (float): The cost associated with the ID for the given time period.
            
        filename (str, optional): Output filename for the CSV. Defaults to 'cost_report.csv'.

    Returns:
        None: Writes directly to file but doesn't return any value.
