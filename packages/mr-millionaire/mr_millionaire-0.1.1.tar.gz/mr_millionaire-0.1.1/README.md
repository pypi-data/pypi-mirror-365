```

It will ask for the environemnt variable name & key.

```
# Example:
LLM Environment Variable Name : GROQ_API_KEY
LLM Environment Variable Value : <your_api_key>
LLM Model (eg: groq/gemma2-9b-it) : groq/gemma2-9b-it
```

Please go through 'https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers' before giving the llm environment values.
