---

CORNETO is a Python framework for inferring biological networks from omics data by framing them as optimisation problems. It provides a unified, flexible, and extensible API to solve a wide range of network inference problems, including signalling pathway and metabolic model reconstruction.

## Why CORNETO?

| Feature | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| üß© **Unified optimisation core** | Express causal signaling, FBA, PCSF & more with the same primitives. |
| üéØ **Exact, solver-backed answers** | LP/MILP formulations guarantee optimality |
| üìä **Multi-sample power** | Borrow strength across conditions for cleaner, comparable subnetworks. |
| üîß **Modular & extensible** | Plug-in new constraints, priors, or scoring functions in a few lines of code. |
| ‚ö° **Blazing-fast** | Supports CVXPY and PICOS backends with dozens of solvers. |



## üöÄ Installation

### Recommended Installation

For most users, we recommend creating a conda environment and installing the research flavor:

```bash
conda create -n corneto python>=3.10
conda activate corneto
conda install python-graphviz
pip install corneto[research]
```

This installs CORNETO with all research dependencies including Gurobi, PICOS, and visualization libraries.

### Standard Installation

The minimal installation via pip provides core functionalities:

```bash
pip install corneto
```

### Optional dependencies

CORNETO provides several optional dependency groups:

- **`research`**: Full research stack with Gurobi, PICOS, visualization, and network tools
- **`os`**: Open-source solvers (SCIP, HiGHS) with visualization and network tools
- **`ml`**: Machine learning dependencies (JAX, Keras, scikit-learn)

Install any combination with:
```bash
pip install corneto[research,ml]  # Multiple extras
```

### Gurobi Installation

For research problems, we strongly recommend using the Gurobi solver. Gurobi is a commercial solver that offers free academic licences. To install and configure Gurobi, please refer to the [official Gurobi documentation](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/). After installation, you can verify that Gurobi is correctly set up by running:

```python
from corneto.utils import check_gurobi
check_gurobi()
```

### Development Installation

If you plan to contribute to CORNETO, we recommend using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for dependency management.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saezlab/corneto.git
cd corneto
poetry install --with dev
```

### Legacy Compatibility

The stable version used by [LIANA+](https://liana-py.readthedocs.io/) and [NetworkCommons](https://networkcommons.readthedocs.io/) remains available. However, we recommend using the latest version for new projects to access the latest features and improvements described in our manuscript.
