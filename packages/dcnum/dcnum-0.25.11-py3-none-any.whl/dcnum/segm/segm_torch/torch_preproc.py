    """Transform image data to something torch models expect

    The transformation includes:

    - normalization (division by 255, subtraction of mean, division by std)
    - cropping and padding of the input images to `image_shape`. For padding,
      the median of each *individual* image is used.
    - casting the input images to four dimensions
      (batch_size, 1, height, width) where the second axis is "channels"

    Parameters
    ----------
    images:
        Input image array (batch_size, height_in, width_in). If this is a
        2D image, it will be reshaped to a 3D image with a batch_size of 1.
    norm_mean:
        Mean value used for standard score data normalization, i.e.
        `normalized = `(images / 255 - norm_mean) / norm_std`; Set
        to None to disable normalization.
    norm_std:
        Standard deviation used for standard score data normalization;
        Set to None to disable normalization (see above).
    image_shape
        Image shape for which the model was created (height, width).
        If the image shape does not match the input image shape, then
        the input images are padded/cropped to fit the image shape of
        the model.

    Returns
    -------
    image_proc:
        3D array with preprocessed image data of shape
        (batch_size, 1, height, width)
