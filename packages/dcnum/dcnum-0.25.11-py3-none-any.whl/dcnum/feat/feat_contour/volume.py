    """Calculate the volume of a polygon revolved around an axis

    The volume estimation assumes rotational symmetry.

    Parameters
    ----------
    contour: list of ndarrays of shape (N,2)
        One entry is a 2D array that holds the contour of an event
    pos_x: float ndarray of length N
        The x coordinate(s) of the centroid of the event(s) [µm]
    pos_y: float ndarray of length N
        The y coordinate(s) of the centroid of the event(s) [µm]
    pixel_size: float
        The detector pixel size in µm.

    Returns
    -------
    volume: float ndarray
        volume in um^3

    Notes
    -----
    The computation of the volume is based on a full rotation of the
    upper and the lower halves of the contour from which the
    average is then used.

    The volume is computed radially from the center position
    given by (``pos_x``, ``pos_y``). For sufficiently smooth contours,
    such as densely sampled ellipses, the center position does not
    play an important role. For contours that are given on a coarse
    grid, as is the case for deformability cytometry, the center position
    must be given.

def vol_revolve(r, z, point_scale=1.):
    r"""Calculate the volume of a polygon revolved around the Z-axis

    This implementation yields the same results as the volRevolve
    Matlab function by Geoff Olynyk (from 2012-05-03)
    https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/36525-volrevolve.

    The difference here is that the volume is computed using (a much
    more approachable) implementation using the volume of a truncated
    cone (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kegelstumpf).

    .. math::

      V = \frac{h \cdot \pi}{3} \cdot (R^2 + R \cdot r + r^2)

    Where :math:`h` is the height of the cone and :math:`r` and
    ``R`` are the smaller and larger radii of the truncated cone.

    Each line segment of the contour resembles one truncated cone. If
    the z-step is positive (counter-clockwise contour), then the
    truncated cone volume is added to the total volume. If the z-step
    is negative (e.g. inclusion), then the truncated cone volume is
    removed from the total volume.

    Parameters
    ----------
    r: 1d np.ndarray
        radial coordinates (perpendicular to the z axis)
    z: 1d np.ndarray
        coordinate along the axis of rotation
    point_scale: float
        point size in your preferred units; The volume is multiplied
        by a factor of `point_scale**3`.

    Notes
    -----
    The coordinates must be given in counter-clockwise order,
    otherwise the volume will be negative.
