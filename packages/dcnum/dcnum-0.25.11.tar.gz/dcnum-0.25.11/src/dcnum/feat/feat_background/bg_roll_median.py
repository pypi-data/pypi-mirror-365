        """Rolling median RT-DC background image computation

        1. There is one big shared array `shared_input` that contains
           the image data for each batch.
        2. User specifies batch size (10000) and kernel size (default
           is 100)
        3. There is a second shared array `shared_output` that contains
           the median values corresponding to the data in `shared_input`.
        4. Background computation is done by copying the input images
           from a file into the shared array.
        5. The input array is split into and workers compute the
           rolling median for each point in `shared_input`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        input_data: array-like or pathlib.Path
            The input data can be either a path to an HDF5 file with
            the "evtens/image" dataset or an array-like object that
            behaves like an image stack (first axis enumerates events)
        output_path: pathlib.Path
            Path to the output file. If `input_data` is a path, you can
            set `output_path` to the same path to write directly to the
            input file. The data are written in the "events/image_bg"
            dataset in the output file.
        kernel_size: int
            Kernel size for median computation. This is the number of
            events that are used to compute the median for each pixel.
        batch_size: int
            Number of events to process at the same time. Increasing this
            number much more than two orders of magnitude larger than
            ``kernel_size`` will not increase computation speed. Larger
            values lead to a higher memory consumption.
        compress: bool
            Whether to compress background data. Set this to False
            for faster processing.
        num_cpus: int
            Number of CPUs to use for median computation. Defaults to
            `multiprocessing.cpu_count()`.
