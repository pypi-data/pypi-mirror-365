def postprocess_masks(masks,

    """Postprocess mask images from ML segmenters

    The transformation includes:

    - Revert the cropping and padding operations done in
      :func:`.preprocess_images` by padding with zeros and cropping.
    - If the original image shape is larger than the mask image shape,
      also clear borders in an intermediate step
      (maks postprocessing using :func:`Segmenter.process_mask`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    masks: 3d or 4d ndarray
        Mask data in shape (batch_size, 1, imagex_size, imagey_size)
        or (batch_size, imagex_size, imagey_size).
    original_image_shape: tuple of (int, int)
        The required output mask shape for one event. This required for
        doing the inverse of what is done in :func:`.preprocess_images`.

    Returns
    -------
    labels_proc: np.ndarray
        An integer array with the same dimensions as the original image
        data passed to :func:`.preprocess_images`. The shape of this array
        is (batch_size, original_image_shape[0], original_image_shape[1]).
