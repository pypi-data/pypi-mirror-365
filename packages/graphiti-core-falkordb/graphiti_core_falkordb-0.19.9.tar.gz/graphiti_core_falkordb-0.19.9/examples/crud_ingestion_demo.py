Demo showing how CRUD operations on entities now trigger the full ingestion pipeline.

This demonstrates that when you create, update, or delete entities via the CRUD API,
the system automatically creates episodes that go through the same ingestion pipeline
as regular content, ensuring consistency and relationship extraction.
