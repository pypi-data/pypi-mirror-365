# WordSearch Generator

A simple word search puzzle generator in Python.  
Supports horizontal, vertical, and diagonal word placements.  
Returns a clean 2D array that you can further customize and display however you like.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Automatically fits all words into a square grid
- Supports custom languages (via `alphabets.py`)
- Places words in:
  - Horizontal ↔️
  - Vertical ↕️
  - Diagonal ↘️ directions
- Returns a ready-to-use 2D array (no output to file or console by default)

---

## 🧪 Example

```python
from wordsearch import WordSearch
from alphabets import Alphabets

words = ["painter", "back", "board", "cactus", "reliance"]
ws = WordSearch(words, language=Alphabets.ENGLISH)

for row in ws.grid:
    print(" ".join(row))
```

Output: *(will vary due to randomness)*

```
P A I N T E R S E T
C R A N G E M A I P
...
```
