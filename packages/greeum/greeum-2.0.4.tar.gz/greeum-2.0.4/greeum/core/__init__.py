"""
Greeum Core Memory Engine

This module contains the core components for STM/LTM memory architecture:
- BlockManager: Long-term memory with blockchain-like structure
- STMManager: Short-term memory with TTL-based management
- CacheManager: Waypoint cache for context-relevant retrieval
- PromptWrapper: Automatic prompt composition with memories
- DatabaseManager: Database abstraction layer
- SearchEngine: Advanced multi-layer search with BERT reranking
- VectorIndex: FAISS vector indexing for semantic search
- WorkingMemory: STM working set management
