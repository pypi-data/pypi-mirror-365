# billingplatform-py

Welcome! This is a community-driven Python library for interacting with BillingPlatform APIs! This project aims to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-use interface for developers working with BillingPlatform.

## Installation

You can install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install billingplatform
```

## Usage

While still under active development towards version 1.0, you can start using the library for its current functionality. Here's a basic example:

```python
from billingplatform import BillingPlatform

# Initialize the API client (creates the session)
# Just in case it has to be said, don't hardcode your credentials in production code ;-)
bp = BillingPlatform(base_url="https://sandbox.billingplatform.com/myorg", username="myuser", password="mypassword")

# Fetch a list of accounts
try:
    response: dict = bp.query(sql="SELECT Id, Name, Status FROM ACCOUNT WHERE 1=1")
    accounts: list[dict] = response.get("queryResponse", []) # Strip out data from response

    for account in accounts:
        print(account)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

Please note: The available methods and their functionalities are still being expanded. Refer to the [documentation](docs/README.md), source code, or tests for the most up-to-date usage examples.
