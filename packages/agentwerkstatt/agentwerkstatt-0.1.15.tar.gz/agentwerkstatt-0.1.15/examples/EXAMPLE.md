# Travel Deal Assistant Example

This example demonstrates how to create a specialized AI agent using AgentWerkstatt that helps users find travel deals. The agent is configured to search for travel information and provide comprehensive recommendations.

## Overview

The example creates a travel deal assistant that:
- Uses Claude Sonnet 4 for intelligent responses
- Integrates with web search tools to find current deals
- Includes memory capabilities for context retention
- Provides Langfuse tracing for observability
- Automatically terminates conversations when tasks are complete

## Setup

### 1. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file (or copy from `example.env`) with your API keys:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-..."
OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
TAVILY_API_KEY="tvly-..."
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY="sk-..."
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY="pk-..."
LANGFUSE_HOST="http://localhost:3000"
```

### 2. Agent Configuration

The `agent_config.yaml` file defines the agent's behavior:

```yaml
# LLM Model Configuration
model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"

# Tools Configuration
tools_dir: "../tools/"

# Logging Configuration
verbose: true

# Langfuse Configuration (Optional)
langfuse:
  enabled: true
  project_name: "agentwerkstatt"

# Memory Configuration (Optional)
memory:
  enabled: true
  model_name: "gpt-4o-mini"
  server_url: "http://localhost:8000"

# Agent Objective/System Prompt
agent_objective: |
  You are a helpful assistant that helps finding great travel deals.
  When you have successfully completed assembling a travel package, end your response with '[TASK_COMPLETE]' to indicate that the task is complete.
```

### 3. Running the Example

The example can be run with:

```bash
python agent.py
```

## Code Explanation

```python
from datetime import datetime
from agentwerkstatt import Agent, AgentConfig

# Load configuration from YAML file
config = AgentConfig.from_yaml("agent_config.yaml")

# Create unique session ID for conversation tracking
session_id = f"user-123-chat-{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d-%H%M%S')}"

# Initialize the agent
agent = Agent(config, session_id=session_id)

# Interactive loop with automatic termination
while True:
    user_input = "I want to go to the Caribbean. Find me a good deal for 2 people traveling in November 2025."

    print("🤔 Agent is thinking...")
    response = agent.process_request(user_input)
    print(f"🤖 Agent: {response}")

    # Check if agent wants to terminate
    if "[TASK_COMPLETE]" in response:
        print("\n✅ Agent has indicated the task is complete. Ending conversation.")
        break
```

## Features Demonstrated

- **Intelligent Web Search**: The agent uses tools to search for current travel deals
- **Structured Responses**: Provides organized information with pricing, recommendations, and booking tips
- **Automatic Termination**: Uses `[TASK_COMPLETE]` marker to end conversations naturally
- **Session Management**: Tracks conversations with unique session IDs
- **Memory Integration**: Remembers context across interactions (when enabled)
- **Observability**: Traces conversations with Langfuse for debugging and analysis
