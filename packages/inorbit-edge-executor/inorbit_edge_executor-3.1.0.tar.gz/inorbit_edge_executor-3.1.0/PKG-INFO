# InOrbit Edge Executor

This package allows to execute InOrbit missions in connector robots.

## Version >=3.0.0 disclaimer

Note that version 3.0.0 introduces some breaking changes compared to 2.0.0.

* Removed `MissionTrackingDatasource` (to be re-implemented as an optional dependency in a future
version).
* A new `DefaultTreeBuilder` that can be used to build behavior trees from mission definitions
with the behavior nodes included in this package.

In exchange `3.0.0` provides several fixes and feature parity with InOrbit's cloud executor.
