One of the things curious about managing a game collection that doubles as a
backlog is, you get games on systems that were originally on other systems. How
do you classify those games? The original game is the actual content you're
playing, but you bought it for the newer system! If you track ownership
correctly, you'll put it under the new system. If you care about tracking the
original release, you're a little stuck.

A perfect example is Virtual Console games on the Wii, WiiU, and 3DS. These
games should have their ownership tracked under Wii, WiiU, or 3DS, but the
original releases are on NES, SNES, etc. Ideally, it should be tracked as a
duplicate of the respective game on NES and SNES if you've owned or beaten them.
That hints toward needing games to have pointers of some sort, to add some
meaning to what's *truly* owned, and what's *been played through*.

This points to the idea of release types. More experimentation is needed.
