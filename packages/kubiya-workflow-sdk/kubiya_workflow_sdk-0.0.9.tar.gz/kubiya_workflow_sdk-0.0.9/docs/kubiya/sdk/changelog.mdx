## Upgrade Guide

### From 1.x to 2.0

#### Client Initialization

**Before (1.x):**
```python
from kubiya_sdk import KubiyaClient

client = KubiyaClient(
    token="...",
    base_url="..."
)
```

**After (2.0):**
```python
from kubiya_workflow_sdk import Client

client = Client(
    api_key="key_...",
    api_url="https://api.kubiya.ai"
)
```

#### Workflow Definition

**Before (1.x):**
```python
workflow = Workflow("my-workflow")
workflow.add_step(ShellStep("echo", "echo 'Hello'"))
workflow.add_step(PythonStep("process", "print('Processing')"))
```

**After (2.0):**
```python
@workflow(name="my-workflow")
def my_workflow():
    step.shell("echo 'Hello'", name="echo")
    step.python("print('Processing')", name="process")
```

#### Streaming

**Before (1.x):**
```python
# Not supported
result = client.run_workflow(workflow)
print(result)
```

**After (2.0):**
```python
# Real-time streaming
for event in client.execute_workflow(workflow, stream=True):
    if event.type == "log":
        print(event.data["message"])
```

#### Error Handling

**Before (1.x):**
```python
try:
    client.run_workflow(workflow)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**After (2.0):**
```python
from kubiya_workflow_sdk.errors import (
    ValidationError,
    ExecutionError,
    StepError
)

try:
    client.execute_workflow(workflow)
except StepError as e:
    print(f"Step {e.step_name} failed: {e.message}")
except ExecutionError as e:
    print(f"Workflow failed: {e}")
```
