# Why Choose Kubiya?

## The Problem with Traditional Approaches

### AI Agent Frameworks: Unpredictable Chaos
- **Non-deterministic**: Same input can produce different execution paths
- **Hard to debug**: Complex agent interactions make troubleshooting nearly impossible
- **Production risks**: Unpredictable behavior in critical environments
- **State management hell**: Agents accumulate state leading to drift

### Traditional Orchestrators: Manual Complexity
- **No AI capabilities**: Everything must be manually coded
- **Steep learning curve**: Complex DSLs and configurations
- **Limited flexibility**: Hard to adapt to changing requirements
- **Slow development**: Every workflow requires extensive coding

## Key Differentiators

### 1. **Deterministic by Design**

    A[Input] --> B[Workflow]
    B --> C[Step 1]
    C --> D[Step 2]
    D --> E[Step 3]
    E --> F[Output]

    style F fill:#2196F3
```

Unlike agent frameworks where execution paths vary, Kubiya workflows follow the exact same path every time.

### 2. **Application Layer Security**
- No direct infrastructure access required
- No god-mode Kubernetes permissions
- Complete audit trail of all actions
- Runs in isolated containers

### 3. **AI as a Tool, Not a Controller**
```python
# AI generates the workflow
workflow = adk.compose("Deploy my app with health checks")

# But execution is deterministic
result = execute_workflow(workflow)  # Same result every time
```

### 4. **Production-Ready from Day One**
- Built-in error handling and retries
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Rollback capabilities
- Health checks and validations
