# MCP Examples

Real-world examples showing how to use Kubiya's MCP server with different AI assistants and use cases.

## Quick Start Examples

### 1. Basic Tool Execution

Ask your AI assistant (Claude, Cursor, etc.):

```
"Can you check the health of our Kubernetes cluster?"
```

Kubiya will execute:
- `kubectl get nodes` - Check node health
- `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces` - List all pods
- `kubectl top nodes` - Check resource usage

### 2. Execute Custom Script

```
"Run a Python script that analyzes our application logs"
```

Kubiya will:
- Create a Python container
- Execute your analysis script
- Return results with live streaming

### 3. Multi-Step Workflow

```
"Deploy version 2.1.0 to staging, run tests, and promote to production if successful"
```

Kubiya handles the entire pipeline:
- Build Docker image
- Deploy to staging
- Run integration tests
- Promote to production if tests pass

## AI Assistant Integrations

### Claude Desktop

After configuring Claude Desktop with the MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kubiya": {
      "command": "kubiya",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"],
      "env": {
        "KUBIYA_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Try these commands:

**Infrastructure Management:**
```
"List all runners and check their health status"
"Execute kubectl get pods in production namespace"
"Check disk space on all servers"
```

**Automation:**
```
"Create a backup of our PostgreSQL database"
"Deploy the latest version of our API service"
"Run our nightly data processing job"
```

### Cursor IDE

With Cursor configured:

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "kubiya": {
      "command": "kubiya",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"],
      "env": {
        "KUBIYA_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use in Composer:

**Development Workflow:**
```
"Use Kubiya to run our test suite on the dev cluster"
"Deploy this branch to staging for testing"
"Check the logs for any errors in the last hour"
```

**Code Analysis:**
```
"Run security scans on our codebase"
"Check code coverage for our tests"
"Analyze performance metrics for our API"
```

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. DevOps Assistant

**Request:** "Our application seems slow, can you investigate?"

**AI + Kubiya Response:**
1. Checks application metrics using monitoring tools
2. Analyzes recent logs for errors
3. Examines resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)
4. Identifies bottlenecks
5. Suggests optimizations

**Example Tools Used:**
- `execute_tool` with kubectl commands
- `execute_tool` with custom monitoring scripts
- `search_kb` for troubleshooting guides

### 2. Database Operations

**Request:** "Create a backup of our production database"

**Kubiya executes:**
```bash
# Create timestamped backup
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
pg_dump -h prod-db -U backup_user myapp > backup_${TIMESTAMP}.sql

# Compress backup
gzip backup_${TIMESTAMP}.sql

# Upload to S3
aws s3 cp backup_${TIMESTAMP}.sql.gz s3://db-backups/myapp/
```

### 3. Security Scanning

**Request:** "Check for any security issues in our infrastructure"

**AI + Kubiya:**
1. Scans container images for vulnerabilities
2. Checks Kubernetes configurations for security issues
3. Reviews access controls and permissions
4. Validates compliance with security policies
5. Generates comprehensive security report

### 4. Data Processing Pipeline

**Request:** "Process today's user analytics and update the dashboard"

**Kubiya Pipeline:**
1. Extracts data from multiple sources (databases, APIs)
2. Runs ETL transformations using pandas/numpy
3. Validates data quality
4. Updates data warehouse
5. Refreshes BI dashboards

## Advanced Examples

### 1. Multi-Cloud Deployment

**Request:** "Deploy our application to both AWS and GCP"

**Kubiya orchestrates:**
- AWS ECS deployment
- GCP Cloud Run deployment
- Load balancer configuration
- Health checks for both environments

### 2. Incident Response

**Request:** "We have a P1 incident, please investigate and remediate"

**AI + Kubiya:**
1. Gathers system metrics and logs
2. Identifies root cause
3. Implements immediate fixes
4. Scales resources if needed
5. Documents incident timeline

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline

**Request:** "Set up continuous deployment for our new microservice"

**Kubiya configures:**
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Docker build and push
- Kubernetes deployment
- Testing and validation
- Rollback mechanisms

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Tool Chaining

Execute multiple tools in sequence:

```
"First check the database connections, then restart any failed services, and finally verify everything is working"
```

### 2. Conditional Execution

Use logic in your requests:

```
"If the staging tests pass, deploy to production, otherwise send me the test results"
```

### 3. Parallel Processing

Handle multiple tasks simultaneously:

```
"Check the health of all our services and generate a status report"
```

## Configuration Examples

### Basic Configuration

```json
{
  "enable_runners": true,
  "allow_platform_apis": false,
  "enable_opa_policies": false,
  "verbose_logging": false
}
```

### Enterprise Configuration

```json
{
  "enable_runners": true,
  "allow_platform_apis": true,
  "enable_opa_policies": true,
  "verbose_logging": true,
  "whitelisted_tools": [
    {
      "name": "kubectl",
      "description": "Kubernetes CLI tool",
      "type": "docker",
      "image": "kubiya/kubectl-light:latest"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error Handling

### Graceful Failure

When tools fail, Kubiya provides detailed error information:

```
"The kubectl command failed because the cluster is unreachable. 
Would you like me to try connecting to the backup cluster?"
```

### Retry Logic

Built-in retry mechanisms for transient failures:

```
"Retrying connection to database... (attempt 2/3)"
```

## Monitoring and Logging

### Execution Tracking

All tool executions are logged with:
- Execution time
- Exit codes
- Resource usage
- Error messages

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:

```bash
kubiya mcp serve --verbose
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Security First

- Always use appropriate access controls
- Enable OPA policies for production
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Monitor tool execution logs

### 2. Resource Management

- Use appropriate runners for different workloads
- Monitor resource usage
- Set timeouts for long-running tasks

### 3. Error Handling

- Implement proper error handling
- Use retries for transient failures
- Provide meaningful error messages
