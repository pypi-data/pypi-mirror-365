# Migration Guide

This guide helps you upgrade between major versions of the Kubiya Workflow SDK.

## Migrating from 1.x to 2.0

### Breaking Changes

<Warning>
Version 2.0 includes some breaking changes. Please review carefully before upgrading.
</Warning>

#### 1. Default Runner Changed

The default runner has changed from `core-testing-2` to `auto`:

```python
# Old (1.x)
workflow = Workflow(name="test", runner="core-testing-2")

# New (2.0)
workflow = Workflow(name="test")  # Uses "auto" by default
```

#### 2. Client API Updates

New methods added to the Client class:

```python
# New in 2.0
client = Client()
runners = client.get_runners()
integrations = client.get_integrations()
secrets = client.get_secrets_metadata()
org_info = client.get_organization_info()
```

#### 3. Streaming Format

SSE streaming now requires the `native_sse` parameter:

```python
# Old (1.x)
for event in client.execute_workflow(workflow, stream=True):
    pass

# New (2.0) - Better SSE support
for event in client.execute_workflow(workflow, stream=True):
    # Events now properly parsed with native SSE format
    pass
```

### New Features

#### AI-Powered Workflow Generation

```python
from kubiya_workflow_sdk.providers import get_provider

# New ADK provider
adk = get_provider("adk")

# Generate workflows from natural language
result = await adk.compose(
    task="Create a backup workflow",
    mode="plan"
)
```

#### SDK Server

```bash
# New server command
kubiya-server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Migration Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update Dependencies">
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade kubiya-workflow-sdk[all]
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update Runner References">
    Search for `runner="core-testing-2"` and replace with `runner="auto"` or remove the parameter.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test Streaming">
    Test your streaming code to ensure it handles the new SSE format correctly.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add API Keys">
    If using ADK provider, add the required API keys:
    ```bash
    export TOGETHER_API_KEY="your-key"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Migrating from 0.x to 1.0

### Breaking Changes

1. **Workflow Definition**: Changed from dict to object-based
2. **Step Dependencies**: Now use explicit `depends` parameter
3. **Execution API**: New streaming interface

### Example Migration

```python
# Old (0.x)
workflow = {
    "name": "test",
    "steps": [
        {"name": "step1", "cmd": "echo hello"}
    ]
}

# New (1.0+)
from kubiya_workflow_sdk import Workflow, Step

workflow = Workflow(
    name="test",
    steps=[
        Step(name="step1", command="echo hello")
    ]
)
```

## Best Practices

  <Card title="Test Thoroughly" icon="flask">
    Always test workflows in a staging environment before upgrading production
  </Card>
  <Card title="Backup Workflows" icon="database">
    Export your workflow definitions before upgrading
  </Card>
  <Card title="Update Gradually" icon="stairs">
    Migrate workflows one at a time rather than all at once
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitor Execution" icon="chart-line">
    Watch for any changes in execution behavior after upgrade
