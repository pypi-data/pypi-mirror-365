# selenium-wire-undetected-chromedriver

This project is an extension of [selenium-wire-lw](https://github.com/LunarWatcher/selenium-wire/) that adds an `UndetectedChrome` driver. This project only contains the `UndetectedChrome` webdriver. selenium-wire-lw is MIT-licensed and therefore compatible with GPLv3, but because GPL, this only works if selenium-wire-lw is a dependency. To avoid the implications of relicensing code, `UndetectedChrome` has to be separate from the main project, even though it's an optional dependency. Thanks, GPL.

For documentation and bug reports with selenium-wire itself, go to [selenium-wire-lw](https://github.com/LunarWatcher/selenium-wire/). Bug reports about specifically the undetected_chromedriver integration go in this repo.

## Usage
```
pip3 install selenium-wire-undetected-chromedriver
```
```python
from seleniumwire_gpl import UndetectedChrome

driver = UndetectedChrome(...)
```

For extended config and selenium-wire features, see the [selenium-wire repo](https://github.com/LunarWatcher/selenium-wire/)
