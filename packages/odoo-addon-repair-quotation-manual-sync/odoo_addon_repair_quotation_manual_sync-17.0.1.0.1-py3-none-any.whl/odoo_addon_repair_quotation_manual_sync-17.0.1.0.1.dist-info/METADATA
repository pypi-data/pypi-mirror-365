This module introduces synchronization logic between Repair Orders and
the related Quotations.

1. Adds an "Invoiceable" checkbox on lines of a repair order to
   determine which products are billable.
2. Only lines marked as "Invoiceable" are included when creating the
   quotation.
3. Any changes in the Repair Order will trigger a banner in the
   quotation if there is a mismatch.
4. An "Synchronize Lines" button in the banner allows syncing the
   quotation lines with the lines indicated as "Invoiceable" in the
   repair order.
