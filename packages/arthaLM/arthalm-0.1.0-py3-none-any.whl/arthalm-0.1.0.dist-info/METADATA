# Artha Language Model (ArthaLM)

## World's First & Most Affordable Custom LLM â€“ Built by a Teen

**Artha-1** is the **world's first Liquid Neural Network-powered language model pipeline** trained and deployed end-to-end by an independent teen researcher. Unlike traditional LLMs that require millions of dollars, proprietary infrastructure, and industrial compute clusters, **Artha-1 was built in under 3 days using accessible tools and mid-range hardware.**

### What Makes It a World First?

-  **LNN-Based Reasoning Core:**  
  This is the **first open-source LLM** to integrate a **Liquid Neural Network (LNN)** core for deep, dynamic reasoning inside compressed latent space.

-  **Built With ~Zero Budget:**  
  Trained using just local GPUs and open datasets, **no enterprise backing or funding** was involved. This makes Artha-1 arguably the **cheapest working LLM** architecture available to the public.

-  **Created by a Teen Researcher:**  
  From architecture design and training to deployment and packaging, every step was executed by an **independent teen developer**, proving that **you donâ€™t need a PhD or billion-dollar lab** to innovate in AI.
