## Installation

A brew formula is a WIP. Until then, use pipx. Which can be installed with `brew install pipx`
Pipx is like brew, only for python.

```bash
# Install using pipx (recommended)
pipx install kge-kubectl-get-events
```

```bash
# Or install using pip, but not as easy
pip install kge-kubectl-get-events
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

View events for a specific pod:

```bash
kge <pod-name>
```

View all events in the current namespace:

```bash
kge -a
```

View only non-normal events:

```bash
kge -e
```

Combine flags to view all non-normal events in the current namespace:

```bash
kge -ea
```

View events in a specific namespace:

```bash
kge -n <namespace>
```

### Viewing Events for Any Resource Type

View events for a specific resource type:

```bash
kge -k <kind> <resource-name>
```

### Interactive Mode

Run without arguments for interactive pod selection:

```bash
kge
```

Check a different namespace than your current context:

```bash
kge -n kubecost
```

### Shell Completion

Enable zsh completion:

```bash
source <(kge --completion=zsh)
```

Completion features:

- Tab completion for namespaces after `-n`
- Tab completion for pods after `-n <namespace>`
- Tab completion for kinds after `-k`
- Tab completion for resources of a specific kind after `-k <kind>`

## Examples

View non-normal events for all pods in a namespace:

```bash
kge -ea
```

View events for a specific pod in a specific namespace:

```bash
kge -n my-namespace my-pod
```

View events for a Deployment:

```bash
kge -k Deployment my-deployment
```

## Known Issues

- Not all arguments work together. For example, `kge -e -k Deployment` will not work. For complex queries, use `kge -a` to see all events and filter with `grep` or another tool.
