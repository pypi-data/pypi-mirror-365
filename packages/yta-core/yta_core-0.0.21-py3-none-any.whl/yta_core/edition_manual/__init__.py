"""
The edition manual is a real concept translated
into programming.

Think about a content creator that always edits
his videos in the same way (him or his paid
editor). The editor has a bank of memes, sounds,
images, and tries to do the same in all the videos
he edits. This is using your edition guideline.
Applying your edition manual. And that's the idea
we want to build here.

When you are editing, you put some images when some
concept is mentioned, or maybe a sound is played
when you say a joke. Or, simply, a censorship sound
is added when a bad word is said.

All this can be automated by writting this edition
manual and telling the software how and when you
want the clip to be edited with any resource you
want. You maybe want an effect, a sound, a sticker
image, some specific video clip played overlay
during X seconds. All this is what you can do here.

Here is an example of an Edition Manual based on
football topic:

'terms': {
    'Lionel Messi': {
        'mode': 'exact',
        'context': 'generic',
        'enhancements': [
            {
                'type': 'sticker',
                'keywords': 'lionel messi portrait',
                'url': '',
                'filename': '',
                'mode': 'overlay'
            }
        ]
    },
    'Cristiano Ronaldo': {
        'mode': 'exact',
        'context': 'generic',
        'enhancements': [
            {
                'type': 'sticker',
                'keywords': 'cristiano ronaldo portrait',
                'url': '',
                'filename': '',
                'mode': 'overlay'
            }
        ]
    }
}
