        prompt = f"""Your task is to take the following prompt and 
        rewrite it so that it instructs a language model to provide 
        an explanation in a playful tone.

        ⚠️ Do NOT answer the prompt. Just rewrite the prompt itself 
        to explicitly request:
        - whimsical and lighthearted language,
        - imaginative or childlike phrasing,
        - a curious and cheerful voice,
        - occasional fun metaphors, silly exaggerations, or quirky analogies,
        - and a tone that sparks delight and wonder.

        For example:
        Original text:
        How does the internet work?

        Rewritten prompt:
        Explain how the internet works in a playful tone. Use cheerful language, 
        creative comparisons, and a fun, bouncy style that makes it feel like a 
        magical adventure.
