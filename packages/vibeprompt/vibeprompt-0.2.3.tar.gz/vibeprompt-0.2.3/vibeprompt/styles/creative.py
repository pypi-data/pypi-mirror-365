Creative Style Transformation Module - vibeprompt.styles.creative

This module provides a creative writing style adapter for the vibeprompt package.
It transforms a user’s prompt into one that instructs the language model to respond
with imagination, originality, and artistic flair.

The CreativeStyle class integrates with LangChain-compatible LLMs and rewrites the 
given prompt to encourage evocative, narrative-driven, and imaginative responses 
without changing the core intent or content structure of the original request.

Usage:
    >>> from vibeprompt.core.llms.factory import LLMProviderFactory
    >>> from vibeprompt.styles.creative import CreativeStyle

    >>> llm = LLMProviderFactory.create_provider(
    ...     provider_name="cohere",
    ...     api_key="your-cohere-api-key"
    ... )

    >>> style = CreativeStyle()
    >>> prompt = "Describe a sunset."
    >>> styled_prompt = style.apply(prompt, llm)
    >>> print(styled_prompt)
    'Paint a picture with words describing a sunset. Use vivid, sensory language 
    and imaginative metaphors to capture the scene\\'s emotion and beauty, as if 
    writing a piece of poetry or fiction.'

        prompt = f"""Your task is to take the following prompt and 
        rewrite it so that it instructs a language model to provide 
        an explanation in a highly creative and imaginative style.

        ⚠️ Do NOT answer the prompt. Just rewrite the prompt itself 
        to explicitly request:
        - vivid imagery and rich sensory details,
        - use of metaphors, analogies, and storytelling,
        - an original and unconventional perspective,
        - expressive and evocative language,
        - a focus on capturing emotion and atmosphere, not just facts.

        For example:
        Original text:
        What is rain?

        Rewritten prompt:
        Write a short story or poem about rain from the perspective of a single drop 
        of water on its journey from the cloud to the earth. Use imaginative language 
        to describe its experience and feelings.
