Seniors Audience Adapter Module - vibeprompt.audiences.seniors

This module provides a senior-oriented audience adapter for the `vibeprompt` package.
It transforms a stylized prompt into a version tailored for an older adult audience,
while preserving the original stylistic tone and creative structure.

The core functionality is exposed through the `SeniorsAudience` class, which integrates with
LangChain-compatible LLMs to produce adapted prompts that resonate with their life experiences,
priorities, and potential concerns such as health, legacy, wisdom, and community, without
altering the creative integrity of the prompt.

Usage:
    >>> from vibeprompt.core.llms.factory import LLMProviderFactory
    >>> from vibeprompt.audiences.seniors import SeniorsAudience

    >>> llm = LLMProviderFactory.create_provider(
    ...     provider_name="cohere",
    ...     api_key="your-cohere-api-key"
    ... )

    >>> adapter = SeniorsAudience()
    >>> prompt = (
    ...     "Reflect on the evolution of technology with a nostalgic, thoughtful tone."
    ... )
    >>> adapted_prompt = adapter.apply(prompt, llm)
    >>> print(adapted_prompt)
    'Reflect on the evolution of technology for a senior audience with a nostalgic, thoughtful tone.
    Connect it to personal milestones, how it has transformed daily life over decades, and its impact
    on family connections and community, inviting contemplation on a lifetime of change while maintaining
    the nostalgic tone.'
