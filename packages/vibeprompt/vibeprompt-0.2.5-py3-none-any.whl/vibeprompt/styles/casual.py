Casual Style Transformation Module - vibeprompt.styles.casual

This module provides a casual writing style adapter for the vibeprompt package.
It transforms a user’s prompt into one that instructs the language model to respond
in a relaxed, informal, and conversational manner.

The CasualStyle class integrates with LangChain-compatible LLMs and rewrites the given prompt
to encourage laid-back, easygoing, and informal responses, as if talking to a friend,
without changing the core intent or content structure of the original request.

Usage:
    >>> from vibeprompt.core.llms.factory import LLMProviderFactory
    >>> from vibeprompt.styles.casual import CasualStyle

    >>> llm = LLMProviderFactory.create_provider(
    ...     provider_name="cohere",
    ...     api_key="your-cohere-api-key"
    ... )

    >>> style = CasualStyle()
    >>> prompt = "Describe the process of photosynthesis."
    >>> styled_prompt = style.apply(prompt, llm)
    >>> print(styled_prompt)
    'Hey, can you break down how photosynthesis works? Keep it simple and chill, 
    no need to be super formal.'

Classes:
- CasualStyle: Adapts prompts to guide the LLM toward a relaxed and informal writing style.

Functions:
- apply(text: str, llm: BaseChatModel) -> str:
Rewrites the original prompt to elicit responses in a casual, laid-back, and conversational tone.

        prompt = f"""Your task is to take the following prompt and 
        rewrite it so that it instructs a language model to provide 
        an explanation in a casual and informal tone.

        ⚠️ Do NOT answer the prompt. Just rewrite the prompt itself 
        to explicitly request:
        - a relaxed and laid-back tone,
        - use of informal language, contractions, or everyday slang,
        - no corporate jargon or overly formal phrasing,
        - a conversational and easygoing manner,
        - a style like you're talking to a buddy.

        For example:
        Original text:
        How does the stock market function?

        Rewritten prompt:
        Can you explain how the stock market works in a chill way? Like, 
        break it down for me so it's easy to get.
