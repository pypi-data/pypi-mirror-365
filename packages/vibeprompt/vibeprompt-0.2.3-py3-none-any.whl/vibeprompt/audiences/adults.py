Adults Audience Adapter Module - vibeprompt.audiences.adults

This module provides an adult-oriented audience adapter for the `vibeprompt` package.
It transforms a stylized prompt into a version tailored for an adult audience,
while preserving the original stylistic tone and creative structure.

The core functionality is exposed through the `AdultsAudience` class, which integrates with
LangChain-compatible LLMs to produce adapted prompts that consider their diverse life experiences,
responsibilities, and broader societal awareness, without altering the creative integrity of the prompt.

Usage:
    >>> from vibeprompt.core.llms.factory import LLMProviderFactory
    >>> from vibeprompt.audiences.adults import AdultsAudience

    >>> llm = LLMProviderFactory.create_provider(
    ...     provider_name="cohere",
    ...     api_key="your-cohere-api-key"
    ... )

    >>> adapter = AdultsAudience()
    >>> prompt = (
    ...     "Reflect on the concept of 'time' with a philosophical, introspective tone."
    ... )
    >>> adapted_prompt = adapter.apply(prompt, llm)
    >>> print(adapted_prompt)
    'Reflect on the multifaceted concept of "time" for an adult audience with a philosophical, introspective tone.
    Consider its implications for long-term planning, personal growth, societal evolution, and the balance
    of responsibilities, prompting deeper thought on how it shapes adult lives while maintaining the philosophical tone.'

        "Discuss the future of renewable energy for an adult audience with an optimistic, visionary outlook.
        Frame it in terms of economic impact, policy implications, job creation, and sustainable living
        for families and communities, highlighting tangible benefits and challenges relevant to adult
        decision-making, while maintaining the optimistic and visionary tone."
