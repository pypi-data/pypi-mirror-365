Professionals Audience Adapter Module - vibeprompt.audiences.professionals

This module provides a professional-oriented audience adapter for the `vibeprompt` package.
It transforms a stylized prompt into a version tailored for professionals in specific or general fields,
while preserving the original stylistic tone and creative structure.

The core functionality is exposed through the `ProfessionalsAudience` class, which integrates with
LangChain-compatible LLMs to produce adapted prompts that emphasize practical application, industry
relevance, career development, and actionable insights, without altering the creative integrity of the prompt.

Usage:
    >>> from vibeprompt.core.llms.factory import LLMProviderFactory
    >>> from vibeprompt.audiences.professionals import ProfessionalsAudience

    >>> llm = LLMProviderFactory.create_provider(
    ...     provider_name="cohere",
    ...     api_key="your-cohere-api-key"
    ... )

    >>> adapter = ProfessionalsAudience()
    >>> prompt = (
    ...     "Explain the new economic policy with a clear, analytical perspective."
    ... )
    >>> adapted_prompt = adapter.apply(prompt, llm)
    >>> print(adapted_prompt)
    'Explain the new economic policy for professionals with a clear, analytical perspective.
    Focus on its practical implications for various industries, potential market shifts, regulatory changes,
    and strategic adjustments required for businesses and career paths, providing actionable insights for their work.'
