Business Audience Adapter Module - vibeprompt.audiences.business

This module provides a business-oriented audience adapter for the `vibeprompt` package.
It transforms a stylized prompt into a version tailored for business and professional audiences,
while preserving the original stylistic tone and creative structure.

The core functionality is exposed through the `BusinessAudience` class, which integrates with
LangChain-compatible LLMs to produce adapted prompts that emphasize business relevance such as
ROI, strategic impact, and value proposition, without altering the creative integrity of the prompt.

Usage:
    >>> from vibeprompt.core.llms.factory import LLMProviderFactory
    >>> from vibeprompt.audiences.business import BusinessAudience

    >>> llm = LLMProviderFactory.create_provider(
    ...     provider_name="cohere",
    ...     api_key="your-cohere-api-key"
    ... )

    >>> adapter = BusinessAudience()
    >>> prompt = (
    ...     "Craft an elegant explanation of artificial intelligence using "
    ...     "sophisticated metaphors and poetic language that flows like a gentle stream of knowledge."
    ... )
    >>> adapted_prompt = adapter.apply(prompt, llm)
    >>> print(adapted_prompt)
    'Craft an elegant explanation of artificial intelligence using sophisticated business metaphors...'
