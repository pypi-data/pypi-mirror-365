Educators Audience Adapter Module - vibeprompt.audiences.educators

This module provides an educator-oriented audience adapter for the `vibeprompt` package.
It transforms a stylized prompt into a version tailored for teachers, instructors, or trainers,
while preserving the original stylistic tone and creative structure.

The core functionality is exposed through the `EducatorsAudience` class, which integrates with
LangChain-compatible LLMs to produce adapted prompts that emphasize pedagogical strategies,
curriculum development, student engagement, and learning outcomes, without altering the creative
integrity of the prompt.

Usage:
    >>> from vibeprompt.core.llms.factory import LLMProviderFactory
    >>> from vibeprompt.audiences.educators import EducatorsAudience

    >>> llm = LLMProviderFactory.create_provider(
    ...     provider_name="cohere",
    ...     api_key="your-cohere-api-key"
    ... )

    >>> adapter = EducatorsAudience()
    >>> prompt = (
    ...     "Explain the concept of critical thinking with a clear, inspiring tone."
    ... )
    >>> adapted_prompt = adapter.apply(prompt, llm)
    >>> print(adapted_prompt)
    'Explain the concept of critical thinking for educators with a clear, inspiring tone.
    Focus on practical pedagogical approaches to foster it in students, integrate it into
    curriculum design, assess its development, and highlight its importance for lifelong
    learning and civic engagement.'
