Teenagers Audience Adapter Module - vibeprompt.audiences.teenagers

This module provides a teenager-oriented audience adapter for the `vibeprompt` package.
It transforms a stylized prompt into a version tailored for a teenage audience,
while preserving the original stylistic tone and creative structure.

The core functionality is exposed through the `TeenagersAudience` class, which integrates with
LangChain-compatible LLMs to produce adapted prompts that are engaging, relatable,
and connect to topics relevant to their lives and interests, without altering the creative
integrity of the prompt.

Usage:
    >>> from vibeprompt.core.llms.factory import LLMProviderFactory
    >>> from vibeprompt.audiences.teenagers import TeenagersAudience

    >>> llm = LLMProviderFactory.create_provider(
    ...     provider_name="cohere",
    ...     api_key="your-cohere-api-key"
    ... )

    >>> adapter = TeenagersAudience()
    >>> prompt = (
    ...     "Explain the importance of financial literacy with a wise, guiding tone."
    ... )
    >>> adapted_prompt = adapter.apply(prompt, llm)
    >>> print(adapted_prompt)
    'Explain the importance of financial literacy to teenagers with a wise, guiding tone.
    Connect it to their future independence, smart spending, and saving for goals like college
    or a first car, making it relevant to their stage of life while maintaining the wise tone.'
