Friendly Style Transformation Module - vibeprompt.styles.friendly

This module provides a friendly writing style adapter for the vibeprompt package.
It transforms a user’s prompt into one that instructs the language model to respond
with warmth, empathy, and approachability.

The FriendlyStyle class integrates with LangChain-compatible LLMs and rewrites the given prompt
to encourage warm, conversational, and encouraging responses without changing the core intent
or content structure of the original request.

Usage:
    >>> from vibeprompt.core.llms.factory import LLMProviderFactory
    >>> from vibeprompt.styles.friendly import FriendlyStyle

    >>> llm = LLMProviderFactory.create_provider(
    ...     provider_name="cohere",
    ...     api_key="your-cohere-api-key"
    ... )

    >>> style = FriendlyStyle()
    >>> prompt = "Explain how blockchain works."
    >>> styled_prompt = style.apply(prompt, llm)
    >>> print(styled_prompt)
    'Could you please explain how blockchain works in a simple and friendly way? 
    I'd appreciate it if you made it easy to understand, as if you were explaining 
    it to a friend.'

        prompt = f"""Your task is to take the following prompt and 
        rewrite it so that it instructs a language model to provide 
        an explanation in a friendly and approachable tone.

        ⚠️ Do NOT answer the prompt. Just rewrite the prompt itself 
        to explicitly request:
        - a conversational and warm tone,
        - simple and accessible language,
        - an empathetic and encouraging vibe,
        - use of positive phrasing,
        - and an overall welcoming and helpful tone.

        For example:
        Original text:
        What are the main causes of climate change?

        Rewritten prompt:
        Hi! Could you explain the main causes of climate change in a clear 
        and friendly way? Please use simple terms that are easy to understand.
