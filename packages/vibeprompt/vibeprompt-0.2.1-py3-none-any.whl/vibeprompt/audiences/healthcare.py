Healthcare Audience Adapter Module - vibeprompt.audiences.healthcare

This module provides a healthcare-focused audience adapter for the `vibeprompt` package.
It transforms a stylized prompt into a version suitable for healthcare professionals—
such as clinicians, researchers, and medical educators—while preserving the original
creative tone and structure.

The `HealthcareAudience` class integrates with LangChain-compatible LLMs and rewrites the
given prompt to introduce medical relevance, clinical context, and evidence-based considerations
without losing the original narrative or stylistic flair.

Usage:
    >>> from vibeprompt.core.llms.factory import LLMProviderFactory
    >>> from vibeprompt.audiences.healthcare import HealthcareAudience

    >>> llm = LLMProviderFactory.create_provider(
    ...     provider_name="cohere",
    ...     api_key="your-cohere-api-key"
    ... )

    >>> adapter = HealthcareAudience()
    >>> prompt = (
    ...     "Describe artificial intelligence as if narrating a healing journey guided by logic and empathy."
    ... )
    >>> adapted_prompt = adapter.apply(prompt, llm)
    >>> print(adapted_prompt)
    'Describe artificial intelligence as if narrating a clinical journey guided by evidence-based decision support...'

        prompt = f"""Your task is to take the following styled prompt and 
        adapt it to be suitable for healthcare professionals, while PRESERVING 
        the original style and tone as much as possible.

        ⚠️ IMPORTANT: 
        - Do NOT answer the prompt
        - Do NOT remove or change the original style elements
        - PRESERVE the creative style, tone, and approach from the original
        - ONLY adapt to add healthcare-focused elements
        
        Your goal is to make the styled prompt medically relevant for healthcare workers while 
        keeping its unique character. Add healthcare-focused elements like:
        - Clinical applications and patient care implications
        - Evidence-based practices and medical protocols
        - Safety considerations and regulatory compliance
        - Diagnostic and therapeutic relevance
        - Maintain the original creative approach/style

        Example:
        Original styled prompt:
        "Craft an elegant explanation of machine learning using sophisticated 
        metaphors and poetic language that flows like a gentle stream of knowledge."

        Adapted for healthcare (preserving style):
        "Craft an elegant explanation of machine learning using sophisticated 
        medical metaphors and clinical language that flows like a diagnostic journey. 
        Frame ML as a diagnostic tool, highlight patient care applications, discuss 
        clinical validation requirements, regulatory considerations, and therapeutic 
        potential while maintaining the poetic elegance and medical relevance."
