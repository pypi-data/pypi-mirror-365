Empathic Style Transformation Module - vibeprompt.styles.empathic

This module provides an empathic writing style adapter for the vibeprompt package.
It transforms a user’s prompt into one that instructs the language model to respond
with understanding, sensitivity, and a focus on emotional resonance.

The EmpathicStyle class integrates with LangChain-compatible LLMs and rewrites
the given prompt to encourage responses that acknowledge feelings, show compassion,
and build rapport, without changing the core intent of the original request.

Usage:
    >>> from vibeprompt.core.llms.factory import LLMProviderFactory
    >>> from vibeprompt.styles.empathic import EmpathicStyle

    >>> llm = LLMProviderFactory.create_provider(
    ...     provider_name="cohere",
    ...     api_key="your-cohere-api-key"
    ... )

    >>> style = EmpathicStyle()
    >>> prompt = "Explain the challenges of remote work."
    >>> styled_prompt = style.apply(prompt, llm)
    >>> print(styled_prompt)
    'Describe the challenges of remote work with an empathic tone, acknowledging
    the emotional toll and difficulties individuals may face. Focus on understanding
    and validating these experiences, offering supportive insights.'

- EmpathicStyle: Adapts prompts to guide the LLM toward an understanding and
  sensitive writing style.

        prompt = f"""Your task is to take the following prompt and
        rewrite it so that it instructs a language model to provide
        an explanation in an empathic and compassionate tone.

        ⚠️ Do NOT answer the prompt. Just rewrite the prompt itself
        to explicitly request:
        - sensitive, understanding, and compassionate language,
        - acknowledgment and validation of emotions,
        - a focus on building rapport and emotional resonance,
        - avoidance of judgmental or dismissive tones.

        For example:
        Original text:
        Tell me about dealing with loss.

        Rewritten prompt:
        Describe how to approach dealing with loss with immense empathy and sensitivity.
        Focus on acknowledging the profound emotional impact, validating feelings of grief,
        and offering comforting, understanding perspectives rather than quick solutions.
