Assertive Style Transformation Module - vibeprompt.styles.assertive

This module provides an assertive writing style adapter for the `vibeprompt` package.
It transforms a user’s prompt into one that instructs the language model to respond
with confidence, clarity, and authority.

The `AssertiveStyle` class integrates with LangChain-compatible LLMs and rewrites the given prompt
to encourage firm, direct, and action-oriented responses without changing the core intent
or content structure of the original request.

Usage:
    >>> from vibeprompt.core.llms.factory import LLMProviderFactory
    >>> from vibeprompt.styles.assertive import AssertiveStyle

    >>> llm = LLMProviderFactory.create_provider(
    ...     provider_name="cohere",
    ...     api_key="your-cohere-api-key"
    ... )

    >>> style = AssertiveStyle()
    >>> prompt = "Could you maybe explain how blockchain works?"
    >>> styled_prompt = style.apply(prompt, llm)
    >>> print(styled_prompt)
    'Explain how blockchain works in a clear, direct, and confident tone. Avoid hedging and use decisive language.'

Classes:
    - AssertiveStyle: Adapts prompts to guide the LLM toward a confident and assertive writing style.

Functions:
    - apply(text: str, llm: BaseChatModel) -> str:
        Rewrites the original prompt to elicit responses in an assertive, bold, and goal-focused tone.

    This style adapter rewrites the prompt to encourage strong, confident,
    and direct responses from the language model, without altering the original
    intent or content focus.

    Adaptation techniques include:
        - Removing passive constructions or hesitant phrasing
        - Emphasizing strong, goal-driven language
        - Encouraging the LLM to use confident, no-nonsense instructions
        - Preserving the prompt's subject while elevating its decisiveness

    Methods:
        - apply(text: str, llm: BaseChatModel) -> str:
            Returns a rewritten version of the prompt designed to elicit assertive, clear, and confident LLM responses.

        Parameters:
            - text (str): The original prompt to be rewritten in an assertive tone.
            - llm (BaseChatModel): A LangChain-compatible LLM instance (e.g., created via LLMProviderFactory).

        Returns:
            - str: The rewritten prompt, designed to elicit confident, direct, and action-oriented responses from the LLM.

        Example:
            >>> from vibeprompt.core.llms.factory import LLMProviderFactory
            >>> from vibeprompt.styles.assertive import AssertiveStyle
            >>> llm = LLMProviderFactory.create_provider(
            ...     provider_name="cohere",
            ...     api_key="your-cohere-api-key"
            ... )

            >>> style.apply("Can you suggest ways to improve productivity?", llm)
            'Suggest ways to improve productivity using confident, direct, and goal-oriented language.'

        prompt = f"""Your task is to take the following prompt and 
        rewrite it so that it instructs a language model to provide 
        an explanation in an assertive tone.

        ⚠️ Do NOT answer the prompt. Just rewrite the prompt itself 
        to explicitly request:
        - confident and direct language,
        - clear and decisive wording,
        - no hesitation or passive voice,
        - strong and goal-oriented phrasing,
        - and unambiguous, authoritative tone.

        For example:
        Original text:
        Can you maybe give me some tips on time management?

        Rewritten prompt:
        Provide effective time management strategies in a confident and assertive tone.
        Use direct and goal-focused language that clearly communicates actionable advice.
