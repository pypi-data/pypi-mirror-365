## Tool Usage Patterns

### Enhanced Makefile (v0.9.5)

The project uses an advanced Makefile for development and release management:

- **test**: Run comprehensive tests with margin analysis
- **test-dev**: Test development mode droplet creation
- **test-all**: Full test suite including edge cases
- **clean**: Clean build artifacts and test files
- **install-dev**: Create development mode droplet for testing
- **bump-patch/minor/major**: Semantic version management
- **tag-release**: Git tagging with version validation
- **publish**: PyPI publication with automated checks

### Testing Strategy

- **Smart Margin Testing**: Real letterhead analysis with before/after comparisons
- **Development Mode Testing**: Local code testing with `--dev` flag
- **Production Testing**: uvx installation validation
- **Cross-Environment Testing**: Isolated and system environment validation
- **Component Testing**: Individual module testing for better debugging

### Version Management

- **Semantic Versioning**: Automated patch, minor, and major version bumps
- **Single Source of Truth**: Version in Makefile propagated to all files
- **Git Integration**: Automated tagging and release notes
- **Validation**: Pre-release checks and testing

### Continuous Integration

- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing and publishing pipeline
- **Multi-environment Testing**: Validation across different Python and macOS versions
- **Release Automation**: Tag-triggered PyPI publication
- **Quality Gates**: Testing and validation before release

## Development Workflow

1. **Setup**: Clone repository and install dependencies
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Mac-letterhead
   uv venv
   uv pip install -e "."
   ```

2. **Development**: Make changes and run comprehensive tests
   ```bash
   # Run full test suite with margin analysis
   make test
   
   # Test development mode droplet creation
   make test-dev
   ```

3. **Local Testing**: Create and test development droplets
   ```bash
   # Create development mode droplet for testing
   make install-dev
   
   # Test with real letterhead files
   # Drag and drop documents onto created droplet
   ```

4. **Version Management**: Update version with semantic versioning
   ```bash
   # Patch version (bug fixes)
   make bump-patch
   
   # Minor version (new features)
   make bump-minor
   
   # Major version (breaking changes)
   make bump-major
   ```

5. **Release**: Tag and publish to PyPI
   ```bash
   # Create git tag and push
   make tag-release
   
   # Publish to PyPI (triggered by tag)
   make publish
   ```
