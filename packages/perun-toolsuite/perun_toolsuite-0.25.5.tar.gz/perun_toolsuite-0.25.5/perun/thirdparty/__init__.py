"""Package for custom ports of third-party packages, libraries or modules.

Some packages, libraries or modules have become unmaintained over the time. This package aims to
centralize those dependencies (perhaps modified or fixed to be compatible with new Python versions)
so that we can continue using them.

We thank all the authors for their contribution to Python community and for allowing us to use them
in our Perun project.
