"""`Bar graphs` displays resources as bars, with moderate customization
possibilities (regarding the sources for axes, or grouping keys). The output
backend of `Bars` is both Bokeh_ and ncurses_ (with limited possibilities
though). Bokeh_ graphs support either the stacked format (bars of different
groups will be stacked on top of each other) or grouped format (bars of
different groups will be displayed next to each other).
