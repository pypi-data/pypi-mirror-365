"""This module contains functions for manipulating statistics files (the so called 'stats')

Stats are basically various data or statistics that need to be stored and manipulated by other
modules, collectors, post-processors etc. The 'stats' file can be indirectly linked to a specific
profile by using the profile 'source' or 'checksum' as a template for the name of the stats file.
Or the stats file might be completely unrelated to profiles by using some custom name.

Stats files are located in the .perun/stats directory under a specific minor version since the
statistics are mostly related to some results or profiles acquired in a specific VCS version. For
storing some temporary data that are unrelated to VCS version, use the 'temp' module.

The format of the stats files is as follows:

{
    'some_ID':
    {
        stats data stored by the user
    },

    'another_ID':
    {
        some other stored data
    },

    'yet_another_ID':
    {
        ...
    }
}

where the IDs uniquely represent stored statistics within the stats file and the ID is used to
identify the data that should be manipulated by the functions.

The contents of the stats file are stored in a compressed form to reduce the memory requirements.
