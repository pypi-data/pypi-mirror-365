"""Base Class for different notions of selecting versions for analysis

This class is not meant to be instantiated and serves as base point for creating
new notions of selecting version. In particular, this should include:

  1. Checking whether some unit (version, a pair of versions, a pair of profiles) should be analysed at all.
  2. For given unit, selecting corresponding unit to form a pair. E.g. for given target version,
     this should return corresponding baseline version.
  3. Finding nearest suitable unit for some given unit: this could be either predecessor or successor in history.
