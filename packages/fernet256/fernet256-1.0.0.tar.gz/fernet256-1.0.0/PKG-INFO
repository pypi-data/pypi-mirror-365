# üîê fernet256 ‚Äî Simplified AES-256 Encryption Inspired by Fernet

`fernet256` is a lightweight and modular encryption library built around **AES-256-CBC** and **HMAC-SHA256**, inspired by the simplicity of the Fernet specification. It provides a clean interface for encrypting and decrypting byte-based payloads with optional integrity and timestamp features.

## ‚ú® Highlights

- AES-256-CBC encryption for secure data protection
- HMAC-SHA256 verification for tamper detection
- Optional timestamp support for expiration control
- Simplified, readable code inspired by Fernet but fully customizable
- Modular design: no opaque black-box structures

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
pip install fernet256
