# Streamlit Rocky Road Tools

A collection of custom Streamlit components and tools.

## Components

### st_notification_bar

A customizable notification bar component for Streamlit applications.

**Features:**
- Displays notification messages with optional "Learn more" links
- Persistent dismissal using localStorage
- Customizable styling with black background and styled buttons
- React + TypeScript implementation
- Full width layout within Streamlit constraints

**Usage:**
```python
import streamlit as st
from st_notification_bar import st_notification_bar

st_notification_bar(
    message="This is a notification from our sponsors.",
    learn_more="https://example.com",
    key="my_notification"
)
```

## Development

Each component has its own frontend directory with React/TypeScript source code.

To develop the notification bar:
```bash
cd st_notification_bar/frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Then run your Streamlit app in another terminal:
```bash
streamlit run st_notification_bar/my_notification_bar_example.py
```
