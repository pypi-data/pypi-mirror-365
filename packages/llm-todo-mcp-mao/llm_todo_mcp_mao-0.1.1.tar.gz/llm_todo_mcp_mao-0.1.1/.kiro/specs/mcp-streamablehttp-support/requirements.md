# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the need to implement proper MCP StreamableHttp protocol support in the Todo MCP Server. The current HTTP server implementation lacks the required MCP protocol endpoints, causing client connection failures with "HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed" errors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an MCP client using StreamableHttp transport, I want to connect to the Todo MCP server over HTTP, so that I can use MCP tools through HTTP instead of stdio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client connects to the server with StreamableHttp transport THEN the server SHALL accept the connection
2. WHEN a client sends MCP protocol messages over HTTP THEN the server SHALL process them correctly
3. WHEN a client requests tool execution THEN the server SHALL return proper MCP responses

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the server to support both stdio and StreamableHttp transports, so that clients can choose their preferred connection method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL support both stdio and HTTP transports simultaneously
2. WHEN using HTTP transport THEN all MCP protocol features SHALL work identically to stdio
3. WHEN switching between transports THEN the tool functionality SHALL remain consistent

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an MCP client, I want proper error handling for HTTP transport, so that I receive meaningful error messages when operations fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an HTTP request fails THEN the server SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes
2. WHEN MCP protocol errors occur THEN they SHALL be properly formatted in HTTP responses
3. WHEN invalid requests are sent THEN the server SHALL return descriptive error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure HTTP transport settings, so that I can customize the server for my deployment environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the server THEN I SHALL be able to set HTTP port and host
2. WHEN enabling HTTP transport THEN it SHALL not interfere with stdio transport
3. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL log the available transport methods
