With this module we'll be able to set the secondary units in the product
matrix for a quick quotation for those products using this kind of
configurator.

**Table of contents**

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

- Go to a product with variants or create one.
- In the *Attributes and variants* tab, *Sales Variant Selection*
  section, select **Order grid entry**.
- In the *General information* tab, *Secondary unit of measure* section,
  add one or several secondary units.
- You can also set a default **Sale secondary unit**.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to a sales order and add the configured product.
2. The matrix dialog will show up and there you'll be able to select the
   available secondary units.
3. If a default sale secondary unit is set, it will selected in the
   dialog already.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- When could have several lines from the same template with different
  secondary units. In that case, the use of the matrix is discarded to
  avoid missmatching values. From that moment, the products are forced
  to be configured with the regular product configurator.
- The client side is roughly implemented right now. Probably we'll fix
  some of the most obvious bugs but our roadmap is headed to v17 with
  the Owl webclient.
