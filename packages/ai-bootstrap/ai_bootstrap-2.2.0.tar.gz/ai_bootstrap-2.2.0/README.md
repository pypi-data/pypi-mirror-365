## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

-   **Python 3.9+**
-   An API key for your chosen LLM provider: [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/), [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/), or [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/).
-   **(Optional)** [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) for running local LLMs.
-   **(Optional)** [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & VS Code [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) for a sandboxed development environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Install the tool directly from PyPI:

```sh
pip install ai-bootstrap
```

---

## üéâ Getting Started

Creating your first production-ready AI application is just a few commands away.

### 1. Set Up Your API Keys

Create a `.env` file in your working directory to store your API keys. The tool will automatically load them.

```ini
# .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-..."
# MISTRAL_API_KEY="..."
# TAVILY_API_KEY="..." # Optional, for web search tools
```

### 2. Create Your First Project (AI-Powered)

This is the recommended and fastest way to get started. Use the `--chat` flag to let the AI Planner configure your project.

```sh
ai-bootstrap create --chat
```

The tool will prompt you for a short description. For example:

> **"I want to build a chatbot that can answer questions about multiple PDF documents using a web interface."**

The AI Planner will analyze this, generate a project plan, ask for your confirmation, and then scaffold the entire project.

### 3. Create a Project (Interactive Mode)

If you prefer to make every decision yourself, run the command without any flags.

```sh
ai-bootstrap create
```

This will launch a guided interactive prompt that walks you through selecting a blueprint, UI framework, LLM provider, and other options.
