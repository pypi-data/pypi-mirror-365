MILESpy is a python interface to the [MILES](http://miles.iac.es) stellar
library and SSP models.  This package aims to provide users an easy interface
to generate single stellar population (SSP) models, navigate the stellar
library or generate a spectra given an input star formation history (SFH),
among other things.  We try to make this package compatible with previously
existing tools, namely [astropy](https://www.astropy.org/) and
[specutils](https://specutils.readthedocs.io).

The documentation can be [browsed online](https://miles-iac.github.io/milespy/).
It has extensive [tutorials and examples](https://miles-iac.github.io/milespy/tutorials/index.html)
to easily start developing.
