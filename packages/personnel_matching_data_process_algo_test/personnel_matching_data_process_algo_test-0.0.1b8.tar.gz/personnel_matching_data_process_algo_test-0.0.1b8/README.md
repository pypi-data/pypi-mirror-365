## Project Information

- **Version:** 0.0.0
- **License:** MIT
- **Author:** GZHU
- **Source Code:** [http://172.22.121.51:8929/personnel-matching/personnel-matching-data-process-algo-v2.git](http://172.22.121.51:8929/personnel-matching/personnel-matching-data-process-algo-v2.git)

## Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to personnel-matching-data-process-algo-v2! Here's a quick guide to get you started:

### Getting Started

1. **Setup Your Environment**: Before you start making changes, set up your
   local development environment. Run:

```bash
pip install uv && uv sync --dev
```

2. **Test the Server**: Ensure the server runs correctly on your local machine:

```bash
poe server
```

3、**Making Changes**：

- **Start Coding**: Once you’ve confirmed everything is set up correctly, you
  can start coding. Make sure to work on a new branch created from the latest
  `main` or `dev` branch.
- **Validate Your Changes**: After making your changes, ensure all tests pass:

```bash
poe test-all
```

## How to Manage a Package with `uv`

To add a new package to the project, use the `uv add` command. This will update
the `pyproject.toml` file and install the new dependency.

### Adding a Regular Dependency

To add a package as a regular dependency, run `uv add` with the package name:

```bash
uv add requests
```

### Adding a Development Dependency

To add a package to a specific group like `dev`, use the `--group` flag:

```bash
uv add pytest –-group dev
```

### Remove a Dependency

To remove a package, use the `uv remove` command:

```bash
uv remove requests
```

## Help

Use `poe help` to get help.

```angular2html
USAGE
  poe [-h] [-v | -q] [-C PATH] [--ansi | --no-ansi] task [task arguments]
```

## About Branches

### Master (`master|main`)

- The `master` branch is the **stable version** of the project.
- It contains the official releases ready for production.
- The `master` or `main` branch is maintained by the administrator only.

### Development (`dev`)

- The `dev` branch is used for **development**.
- New features and fixes are developed and tested here.
- **Beta versions** are managed and released from the `dev` branch for testing
  before they go to `master`.

### Personal Development Branches

- Developers should create a personal branch using their name, e.g., `username`,
  or use a feature branch, e.g., `feat-xxxx`, for new features.
- Once development is completed, submit a **Pull Request (PR)** to the `dev`
  branch for review.

## Commit Message Guidelines

All commit messages must follow the format:

```
<tag>: <Message>
```

### Allowed Tags

The following tags are allowed in commit messages:

- `feat`: New features.
- `fix`: Bug fixes.
- `build`: Changes related to build or dependencies.
- `chore`: Routine tasks that don’t change the code (e.g., updating configs).
- `ci`: Continuous Integration updates.
- `docs`: Documentation changes.
- `perf`: Performance improvements.
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, whitespace, etc.).
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without changing functionality.
- `test`: Adding or updating tests.
- `update`: Minor updates or improvements.

### Versioning Rules

- **Minor version bumps** occur for changes tagged with: `update`.
- **Patch version bumps** occur for changes tagged with: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`,
  `refactor`, `build`.

Ensure your commit messages are concise and meaningful, using the appropriate
tag from the list above.
