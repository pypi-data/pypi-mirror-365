# 📦 filebin-cli

### A simple and hassle-free CLI tool to **share files temporarily** — upload files directly from your terminal. No login. No setup. Just share the link.

Built with ❤️ in Python, `filebin-cli` is a simple and convenient command-line interface for interacting with the file-sharing service [filebin.net](https://filebin.net).

This tool allows you to upload, download, and manage files and bins directly from your terminal, featuring progress bars, **shortcodes for bin access**, and full bin management capabilities.
