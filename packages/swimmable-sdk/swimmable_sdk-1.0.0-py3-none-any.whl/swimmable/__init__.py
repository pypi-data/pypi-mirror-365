Swimmable Python SDK

Official Python SDK for the Swimmable API - Real-time swimming conditions and water quality data.

Example:
    Basic usage with no API key required:
    
    >>> from swimmable import SwimmableClient
    >>> client = SwimmableClient()
    >>> conditions = client.get_conditions(lat=34.0522, lon=-118.2437)
    >>> print(f"Water temperature: {conditions.water_temperature}Â°C")
    
    Enhanced usage with API key:
    
    >>> client = SwimmableClient(api_key="your-api-key-here")
    >>> enhanced = client.get_enhanced_conditions(lat=34.0522, lon=-118.2437)
    >>> print(f"Swimmability score: {enhanced.swimmability_score}/10")
