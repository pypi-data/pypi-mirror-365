A base napari plotter widget for interactive plotting

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html
-->

## Documentation

The full documentation with API and examples can be found [here](https://biapol-biaplotter.readthedocs.io/en/stable).

## Installation

* Make sure you have Python in your computer, e.g. download [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#download).

* Create a new environment, for example, like this:

```
mamba create --name biaplotter-env python=3.11
```

If you never used mamba/conda environments before, take a look at [this blog post](https://biapol.github.io/blog/mara_lampert/getting_started_with_mambaforge_and_python/readme.html).

* **Activate** the new environment with `mamba`:

```
mamba activate biaplotter-env
```

* Install [napari](https://napari.org/stable/), e.g. via `mamba`:

```
mamba install -c conda-forge napari pyqt
```

Afterwards, install `biaplotter` via `pip`:

```
pip install biaplotter
```

To install latest development version :

```
pip install git+https://github.com/BiAPoL/biaplotter.git
```
