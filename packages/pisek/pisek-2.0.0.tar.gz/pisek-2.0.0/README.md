# Pisek ⌛

Tool for developing tasks for programming competitions.
Currently used by:
 - [Kasiopea](https://kasiopea.matfyz.cz/)
 - [Czech Informatics Olympiad](https://mo.mff.cuni.cz/p/)

And was used by:
 - [CEOI 2024](https://ceoi2024.fi.muni.cz/)

## Install

Pisek requires Python ≥ 3.11. Install with pip:
```bash
pip install pisek
```

For upgrading add `--upgrade`:
```bash
pip install pisek --upgrade
```
## Testing tasks

First create a `config` file as documented [here](https://github.com/kasiopea-org/pisek/blob/master/docs/config-v2-documentation).
You can also reference the examples for
[Kasiopea mode](https://github.com/kasiopea-org/pisek/blob/master/fixtures/sum_kasiopea/config)
and [CMS mode](https://github.com/kasiopea-org/pisek/blob/master/fixtures/sum_cms/config).

```bash
pisek test
```

This command tests the task in the current directory.
It tests all task parts (generator, validator, solutions and judge).

### Task testing overview

What pisek verifies:
 - Samples exist
 - The generator generates inputs
    - Generator is deterministic
    - Generator respects seed on seeded inputs
 - The validator accepts all inputs
 - The judge works
    - It accepts the samples
    - It doesn't crash on malicious output
 - The solutions finish as expected
    - They get the expected number of points
    - They succeed/fail on each test (group of testcases) as expected
 - Data files (inputs and outputs) are valid
    - They are in the correct encoding
    - They don't contain unprintable characters
    - They have a newline at the end
    - The files are reasonably small
    - If `one_input_in_each_nonsample_test=on`, there is exactly one input in each non-sample test.
 - The task is complete
    - A CMS judge has no redundant lines in its stdout/stderr
    - All outputs for each test are not the same
    - If `solution_for_each_test=on`, there exists a dedicated solution for each test
 

### Testing given programs

For fast testing of only the solution `solve_cool.cpp` use:
```bash
pisek test solution solve_cool
```

Similarly the generator can be tested using:
```bash
pisek test generator
```

### Cleaning

Pisek can create a lot of files used for testing. Remove them by running:
```bash
pisek clean
```

### Visualization

For visualizing the running time for each solution and testcase:
```bash
pisek test --testing-log  # test the task
pisek visualize      # visualize
```
