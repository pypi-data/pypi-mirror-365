## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0]

### Changed

- Changed `installation_repositories` internal event handlers to automatically create missing `Installation` models using new `(a)get_or_create_from_event` method, eliminating the need for manual import when connecting to pre-existing GitHub App installations.

## [0.8.0]

### Added

- Added `@gh.mention` decorator for handling GitHub mentions in comments. Supports filtering by username pattern (exact match or regex) and scope (issues, PRs, or commits).

### Fixed

- Fixed N+1 query pattern in `installation_repositories` event handlers by fetching all existing repository IDs in a single query instead of checking each repository individually.

## [0.7.0]

### Added

- Added `GITHUB_APP["LOG_ALL_EVENTS"]` setting to control webhook event logging. When `False`, only events with registered handlers are stored in the database.
- Added admin action to bulk delete EventLog entries older than a specified number of days.

## [0.6.1]

### Fixed

- Fixed excessive memory usage in `AsyncWebhookView` and `SyncWebhookView` caused by creating a new `GitHubRouter` instance on each request.

## [0.6.0]

### Added

- Added support for Django 5.2.

### Removed

- Dropped support for Django 5.0.

### Fixed

- Fixed a discrepancy between what the documentation showed about the type expected for `APP_ID` in the `GITHUB_APP` settings dictionary and how the library actually used the setting when creating a new `Installation` instance via the `acreate_from_event`/`create_from_event` custom manager methods.

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- Added `GITHUB_APP["WEBHOOK_TYPE"]` setting to configure async/sync handler selection.

### Removed

- Removed automatic detection of webhook type from URL configuration.

## [0.4.0]

### Added

- Added `SyncWebhookView`, a synchronous counterpart to `AsyncWebhookView` for Django applications running under WSGI. Works with `SyncGitHubAPI` and synchronous event handlers to provide a fully synchronous workflow for processing GitHub webhooks.
- Added system check to prevent mixing async and sync webhook views in the same project (`django_github_app.E001`).
- Added sync versions of internal event handlers for installation and repository webhooks. The library automatically selects async or sync handlers based on the webhook view type configured in your URLs.

### Changed

- `AsyncGitHubAPI` and `SyncGitHubAPI` clients can now take an instance of `Installation` using the `installation` kwarg, in addition to the previous behavior of providing the `installation_id`. One or the other must be used for authenticated requests, not both.

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- Added `SyncGitHubAPI`, a synchronous implementation of `gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI` for Django applications running under WSGI. Maintains the familiar gidgethub interface without requiring async/await.

## [0.2.1]

### Fixed

- `github import-app` management command is now wrapped in an atomic transaction, in case any import steps fail.

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- Added `acreate_from_gh_data`/`create_from_gh_data` manager methods to `Installation` and `Repository` models.
- Added new methods to `Installation` model:
  - `get_gh_client` for retrieving a `GitHubAPI` client preconfigured for an `Installation` instance.
  - `aget_repos`/`get_repos` for retrieving all repositories accessible to an app installation.
- Added `get_gh_client` model method to `Installation` model.
- Added `aget_repos`/`get_repos` model method to `installation`
- Added `arefresh_from_gh`/`refresh_from_gh` model methods to `Installation` model for syncing local data with GitHub.
- Created a new management command namespace, `python manage.py github`, for all django-github-app management commands.
- Added a new management command to `github` namespace, `python manage.py github import-app`, for importing an existing GitHub App and installation.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Created initial models for GitHub App integration:
  - `EventLog` to store webhook events
  - `Installation` to manage GitHub App installations and generate access tokens
  - `Repository` to interact with GitHub repositories and track issues
- Created `AsyncWebhookView` to integrate `gidgethub` webhook handling with Django.
- Created webhook event routing system using `gidgethub.routing.Router`.
- Integrated `gidgethub.abc.GitHubAPI` client with `Installation` authentication.
