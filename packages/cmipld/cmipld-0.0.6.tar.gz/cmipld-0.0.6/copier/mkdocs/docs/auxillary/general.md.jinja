# General

## Folder structure
The navigation menu will mirror that of the the files in the 'docs' folder. Therefore if you wish to group any items, you can nest them within a sub-folder. 

## File format
All files are written in Markdown. This is a human readable text format, which can be rendered and checked within github, and is processed by mkdocs to apply additional functions and styling to produce the wiki/documentation. 

## File naming
If there is no single `#` header on the top, the file name is used for the page. If a header exists, this overwrites the filename in the nav bar/page.
