        Retrieve all variant data and metadata objects that match a query.  ## Metadata full-text queries Single words can be supplied as is, otherwise use speech marks (`\"`) to quote queries that include whitespace. Speech marks and backslash characters in the query need to be escaped with a backslash (`\\`).  ## Metadata filters Metadata filters are key-value pairs joined by an operator. The `=` operator matches literal values/string. The `!=` operator matches anything except the literal value/string. The `<` or `>` operators match numerical results that are less or greater than the supplied value. Strings containing whitespace need to be quoted with (`\"`).  ## Combinations Metadata queries/filters for the same parameter can be combined with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators, using white-space to separate out the terms and operators. Parentheses `( )` can be used for complex expressions.  ## Versioning Specific versions of omics data files (eg. GCT) can be queried via the useVersions parameter. Different versions of an omics data file are associated via their CHAIN_ID metadata value. This CHAIN_ID can be supplied to the useVersions parameter along with the version number or specific omics data file accessions to include them in the query. If nothing is supplied to the useVersions parameter then only the active version (which is usually the last one imported) is queried. This acts as a filter before the rest of the query is carried out.  Example usage: useVersions=* (query all versions, including those without CHAIN_IDs) useVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second version then the data file is not queried) useVersions=v1,v0 (query the first version and any data files without CHAIN_IDs(v0) ) useVersions=GSVC002:v3 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query the third version) useVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query only the specific accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)  Rules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be supplied to the parameter using the ; separator.  ## Paging For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in \"pages\" of limited size together with a `cursor` tag.

        """Retrieve multiple variant data and metadata objects

        Retrieve all variant data and metadata objects that match a query.  ## Metadata full-text queries Single words can be supplied as is, otherwise use speech marks (`\"`) to quote queries that include whitespace. Speech marks and backslash characters in the query need to be escaped with a backslash (`\\`).  ## Metadata filters Metadata filters are key-value pairs joined by an operator. The `=` operator matches literal values/string. The `!=` operator matches anything except the literal value/string. The `<` or `>` operators match numerical results that are less or greater than the supplied value. Strings containing whitespace need to be quoted with (`\"`).  ## Combinations Metadata queries/filters for the same parameter can be combined with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators, using white-space to separate out the terms and operators. Parentheses `( )` can be used for complex expressions.  ## Versioning Specific versions of omics data files (eg. GCT) can be queried via the useVersions parameter. Different versions of an omics data file are associated via their CHAIN_ID metadata value. This CHAIN_ID can be supplied to the useVersions parameter along with the version number or specific omics data file accessions to include them in the query. If nothing is supplied to the useVersions parameter then only the active version (which is usually the last one imported) is queried. This acts as a filter before the rest of the query is carried out.  Example usage: useVersions=* (query all versions, including those without CHAIN_IDs) useVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second version then the data file is not queried) useVersions=v1,v0 (query the first version and any data files without CHAIN_IDs(v0) ) useVersions=GSVC002:v3 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query the third version) useVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query only the specific accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)  Rules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be supplied to the parameter using the ; separator.  ## Paging For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in \"pages\" of limited size together with a `cursor` tag. To retrieve the next page of results please supply this `cursor` tag to resume the query from your previous result and get the next page. If there are no more results you will just retrieve an empty result.

        """Retrieve groups that match a query

        Retrieve all group metadata objects that match a query.  ## Metadata full-text queries Single words can be supplied as is, otherwise use speech marks (`\"`) to quote queries that include whitespace. Speech marks and backslash characters in the query need to be escaped with a backslash (`\\`).  ## Metadata filters Metadata filters are key-value pairs joined by an operator. The `=` operator matches literal values/string. The `!=` operator matches anything except the literal value/string. The `<` or `>` operators match numerical results that are less or greater than the supplied value. Strings containing whitespace need to be quoted with (`\"`).  ## Combinations Metadata queries/filters for the same parameter can be combined with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators, using white-space to separate out the terms and operators. Parentheses `( )` can be used for complex expressions.  ## Versioning Specific versions of omics data files (eg. GCT) can be queried via the useVersions parameter. Different versions of an omics data file are associated via their CHAIN_ID metadata value. This CHAIN_ID can be supplied to the useVersions parameter along with the version number or specific omics data file accessions to include them in the query. If nothing is supplied to the useVersions parameter then only the active version (which is usually the last one imported) is queried. This acts as a filter before the rest of the query is carried out.  Example usage: useVersions=* (query all versions, including those without CHAIN_IDs) useVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second version then the data file is not queried) useVersions=v1,v0 (query the first version and any data files without CHAIN_IDs(v0) ) useVersions=GSVC002:v3 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query the third version) useVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query only the specific accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)  Rules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be supplied to the parameter using the ; separator.  ## Paging For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in \"pages\" of limited size. In order to retrieve all matching results the client needs to request multiple pages starting from an offset to the first result. You can do this using the pageOffset query parameter. A value of 0 (the default) instructs the server to return the first page of results, 100 would return a page of results starting from the 101st result and so on. To return all results iterate through pages using pageOffset values of `n*pageLimit` until the `resultsExhausted` response field is true.  ## List operation  This endpoint can be called with no `query` parameter. Doing so returns a list of all data objects.

        """Retrieve groups that match a query

        Retrieve all group metadata objects that match a query.  ## Metadata full-text queries Single words can be supplied as is, otherwise use speech marks (`\"`) to quote queries that include whitespace. Speech marks and backslash characters in the query need to be escaped with a backslash (`\\`).  ## Metadata filters Metadata filters are key-value pairs joined by an operator. The `=` operator matches literal values/string. The `!=` operator matches anything except the literal value/string. The `<` or `>` operators match numerical results that are less or greater than the supplied value. Strings containing whitespace need to be quoted with (`\"`).  ## Combinations Metadata queries/filters for the same parameter can be combined with `&&`, `AND`, `||` and `OR` operators, using white-space to separate out the terms and operators. Parentheses `( )` can be used for complex expressions.  ## Versioning Specific versions of omics data files (eg. GCT) can be queried via the useVersions parameter. Different versions of an omics data file are associated via their CHAIN_ID metadata value. This CHAIN_ID can be supplied to the useVersions parameter along with the version number or specific omics data file accessions to include them in the query. If nothing is supplied to the useVersions parameter then only the active version (which is usually the last one imported) is queried. This acts as a filter before the rest of the query is carried out.  Example usage: useVersions=* (query all versions, including those without CHAIN_IDs) useVersions=v2 (query the second version. If there is no second version then the data file is not queried) useVersions=v1,v0 (query the first version and any data files without CHAIN_IDs(v0) ) useVersions=GSVC002:v3 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query the third version) useVersions=GSVC002:GSF00494,GSF000496 (for omics data files with a CHAIN_ID of GSCV002 query only the specific accessions GSF00494 and GSF000496)  Rules for multiple CHAIN_IDs can be supplied to the parameter using the ; separator.  ## Paging For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in \"pages\" of limited size. In order to retrieve all matching results the client needs to request multiple pages starting from an offset to the first result. You can do this using the pageOffset query parameter. A value of 0 (the default) instructs the server to return the first page of results, 100 would return a page of results starting from the 101st result and so on. To return all results iterate through pages using pageOffset values of `n*pageLimit` until the `resultsExhausted` response field is true.  ## List operation  This endpoint can be called with no `query` parameter. Doing so returns a list of all data objects.

The parent-child relationship is defined by the key \"broaders\" or \"subClassOf\" in the dictionary.  If the full query term is not present in a dictionary then this parameter has no effect.

        ## Paging For performance reasons this endpoint returns results in \"pages\" of limited size. In order to retrieve all matching results the client needs to request multiple pages starting from an offset to the first result. You can do this using the pageOffset query parameter. A value of 0 (the default) instructs the server to return the first page of results, 100 would return a page of results starting from the 101st result and so on. To retrieve all results, iterate through pages using `pageOffset` values of `n * pageLimit` until a page returns fewer results than the page limit, which indicates there are no more results.
