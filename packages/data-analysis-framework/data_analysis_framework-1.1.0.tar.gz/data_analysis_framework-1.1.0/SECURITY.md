# Security Policy

## üîí Overview

The Data Analysis Framework is designed with security as a fundamental principle, especially considering its use with AI agents and potentially sensitive data. This document outlines our security practices and how to report vulnerabilities.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### AI Agent Safety
- **Query Validation**: All AI-generated queries are validated before execution
- **Safe Query Interface**: Restricted operations prevent dangerous data manipulation
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- **Read-Only Operations**: Default interface prevents data modification
- **Query Complexity Limits**: Protection against resource exhaustion attacks

### Data Protection
- **Local Processing**: All analysis happens locally - no data sent to external services
- **Memory Management**: Secure cleanup of sensitive data from memory
- **Temporary File Handling**: Secure creation and cleanup of temporary files
- **Access Control**: File system access limited to specified directories
- **PII Detection**: Built-in detection of potentially sensitive information

### Code Security
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security audits of dependencies
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all inputs
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak sensitive information
- **Type Safety**: Full type checking to prevent runtime errors
- **Resource Limits**: Protection against memory and CPU exhaustion

## üîç Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ‚úÖ Yes            |
| < 1.0   | ‚ùå No             |

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

**üîí For security vulnerabilities, please DO NOT open a public GitHub issue.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities through one of these channels:

1. **Email**: Send details to `wjackson@redhat.com` with subject "SECURITY: Data Analysis Framework"
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Encrypted Communication**: PGP key available upon request

### What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

```markdown
## Vulnerability Report Template

**Summary**: Brief description of the vulnerability

**Impact**: What could an attacker accomplish?

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

**Affected Versions**: Which versions are impacted?

**Environment**: 
- OS: 
- Python version: 
- Package version: 

**Proposed Fix**: If you have suggestions

**Disclosure Timeline**: Your preferred timeline for public disclosure
```

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Within 2-4 weeks (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and tested

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Safe Data Handling
```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Use with trusted, local data files
analyzer = DataAnalyzer()
result = analyzer.analyze("local_data.xlsx")

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution: Be careful with remote or untrusted files
# Always validate and scan files from external sources
```

#### AI Agent Integration
```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Use safe query interface
interface = create_agent_interface("trusted_data.csv")
result = interface.execute_query("Find customers in Boston")

# ‚ùå Avoid: Don't disable safety features
# interface.disable_safety_checks()  # Never do this
```

#### Environment Security
```python
# ‚úÖ Good: Use virtual environments
# python -m venv venv
# source venv/bin/activate
# pip install data-analysis-framework

# ‚úÖ Good: Keep dependencies updated
# pip install --upgrade data-analysis-framework
```

### For Developers

#### Secure Development
- Always validate inputs before processing
- Use type hints and runtime validation
- Handle errors gracefully without exposing sensitive information
- Sanitize file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Limit resource usage to prevent DoS attacks

#### Testing Security
```python
def test_path_traversal_protection():
    """Test that path traversal attacks are prevented"""
    with pytest.raises(SecurityError):
        analyzer.analyze("../../../etc/passwd")

def test_query_injection_protection():
    """Test that SQL injection is prevented"""
    result = interface.execute_query("'; DROP TABLE users; --")
    assert result.success == False
    assert "Invalid query" in result.warnings
```

## üîß Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Restrict file system access
export DAF_ALLOWED_PATHS="/safe/data/directory"

# Enable additional security logging
export DAF_SECURITY_LOGGING=true

# Set memory limits
export DAF_MAX_MEMORY_MB=1024

# Enable safe mode (extra restrictions)
export DAF_SAFE_MODE=true
```

### Configuration Options
```python
# Configure security settings
analyzer = DataAnalyzer(
    max_file_size_mb=100,
    allowed_extensions=['.csv', '.xlsx'],
    enable_path_validation=True,
    safe_mode=True
)
```

## üö´ Known Security Considerations

### File Processing
- **Large Files**: Memory exhaustion possible with very large files
- **Malformed Files**: Specially crafted files could cause crashes
- **External References**: Excel files with external links are blocked

### AI Integration
- **Query Complexity**: Complex queries may consume significant resources
- **Data Leakage**: AI models might retain information from queries
- **Prompt Injection**: Malicious prompts could bypass safety measures

### Mitigations
- File size limits and memory monitoring
- Input validation and sanitization
- Resource usage limits and timeouts
- Query complexity analysis
- Safe query execution environment

## üìù Security Updates

### Notification Methods
- **GitHub Releases**: Security updates included in release notes
- **Security Advisories**: Critical vulnerabilities announced via GitHub
- **Changelog**: Security fixes documented in CHANGELOG.md
- **Email**: Major security updates can be sent to maintainers

### Update Process
```bash

pip list --outdated | grep data-analysis-framework

# Update to latest secure version
pip install --upgrade data-analysis-framework

# Verify security features
python -c "import data_analysis_framework; print('Security features active')"
```
