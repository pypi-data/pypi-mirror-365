# linml

`baseml` is a lightweight machine learning library built from scratch in Python.  
It currently supports linear regression and core evaluation metrics like MSE and RÂ².  
Ideal for learning, experimentation, and educational purposes.

## Features

- ðŸ“ˆ Linear Regression from scratch
- ðŸŽ¯ Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² Score
- ðŸ§± Easy-to-use API (like `fit()`, `predict()`)
- ðŸ§ª Designed for learning and minimal dependencies

## Installation

```bash
pip install baseml
