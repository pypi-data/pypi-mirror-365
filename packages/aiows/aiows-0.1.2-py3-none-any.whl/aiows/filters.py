TODO: Message filtering functionality

This module is a placeholder for future development of message filtering capabilities.
Currently, no filter functionality is implemented.

Future features may include:
- Message content filtering
- Message routing based on content
- Message transformation pipelines
- Custom filter chains

For now, this module exists to maintain import compatibility and avoid confusion.
Do not reference or document filter functionality until it is actually implemented.
