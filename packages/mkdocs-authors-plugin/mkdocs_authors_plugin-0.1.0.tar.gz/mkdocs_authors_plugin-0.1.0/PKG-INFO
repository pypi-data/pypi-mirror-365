A custom MkDocs plugin designed to dynamically generate an "Authors" page for your documentation site from a simple YAML file. This allows you to easily manage and display information about contributors without manually updating Markdown files.

The YAML format is kept consistent with Material's ["Defining authors"](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/tutorials/blogs/navigation/#defining-authors), which enables blog post author attribution. This means that if you are
creating a blog you will not have to define `.authors.yml` twice. Note that `authors` can be used
independently (without a blog) as well.

## Features

* **Dynamic Page Generation:** Automatically creates an `authors.md` page based on your `.authors.yml` file.

* **Configurable Paths:** Easily customize the input YAML file name and the output Markdown page name.

* **Author Profiles:** Supports fields for name, description, avatar, affiliation, email, and social media links.

## Installation

You can install this plugin using `pip`:

```
pip install mkdocs-authors-plugin
```

If you are developing the plugin locally, navigate to the plugin's root directory (the one containing `pyproject.toml`) and install it in editable mode:

```shell
cd /path/to/your/mkdocs-authors-plugin/
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### 1. Configure `mkdocs.yml`

Add the `authors` plugin to your `plugins` list in your `mkdocs.yml` file. You also need to include the `authors.md` page in your `nav` section.

```yml
# mkdocs.yml
site_name: My Awesome Docs

plugins:
  - search
  - authors:
      # Optional: specify the authors file if it's not .authors.yml
      # authors_file: my_custom_authors.yaml
      # Optional: specify the output page name if it's not authors.md
      # output_page: team.md

nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - Authors: authors.md # This is the page that will be generated by the plugin
  - About: about.md
```

### 2. Create your `.authors.yml` file

Create an `.authors.yml` file in the root directory of your MkDocs documentation project (the same directory as `mkdocs.yml`). This file will contain the data for your authors.

The plugin expects a top-level `authors` key, under which each author is defined by a unique ID (e.g., `author_one`).

You can also define optional page parameters under `page_params`, such as an overall title and 
description.

```yml
# .authors.yml

# Optional: Define page-level parameters for the generated authors page
page_params:
  title: Our Project Team
  description: "Meet the team."
  avatar_size: 150           
  avatar_shape: circle      
  avatar_align: left

# Required: Define individual author data
authors:
  author_one:
    name: Author One
    description: Owner
    avatar: headshot_one.png
    affiliation: British Antarctic Survey
    email: author.one@example.com
    github: authorone
    linkedin: author-one-profile
    twitter: author_one_dev
    orcid: 0123-4567-8910-1112
  author_two:
    name: Author Two
    description: Maintainer
    avatar: headshot_two.png
    affiliation: UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology
    # You can omit any fields not applicable to an author
  author_three:
    name: Author Three
    description: Core Contributor
    avatar: headshot_three.png
    affiliation: University of Edinburgh
```

### 3. Run MkDocs

Navigate to your main MkDocs documentation project root (the directory containing `mkdocs.yml`) and run:

```shell
mkdocs serve
```

The plugin will generate the `authors.md` page, and you should see it in your site's navigation.

### Where is authors.md?
When mkdocs serve detects a file change in `docs/` , it triggers a rebuild. If `authors.md` was
written into `docs/`, that write itself is a "change," leading to an endless cycle of rebuilding.

To prevent this endless loop, the plugin adds a `File` object representing `authors.md` to MkDocs'
internal list of files. This tells MkDocs that there is a page called `authors.md` that should be
part of the documentation build. This mean a physical file does not have to exist at
`docs/authors.md`.

## Other plugins

If you wish to automatically generate authors based on a git repository, [git-authors](https://github.com/timvink/mkdocs-git-authors-plugin) is a tidy plugin to do this.

The `authors-plugin` is developed for instances where you want to manually define an authors list,
for example for a wider project team, or non-code contributors.
