`BharatFinTrack` is a Python package designed to simplify the process of downloading and analyzing financial data from India. Conceptualized on September 1, 2024, and launched on September 8, 2024, this package is tailored for long-term investors seeking to streamline their financial data workflows. The package focuses on open-source financial data, with an initial emphasis on analyzing [Nifty Equity Indices](https://www.niftyindices.com/). However, it is important to note that the package does not include features for technical indicators or real-time trading. Active development is ongoing, with exciting new features planned for future releases. The package aims to empower users by providing easy access to open-source data, enabling them to make informed financial decisions. Currently, the package offers the following features:


## Nifty Equity Indices
    
* Provides access to detailed information about equity indices.
* Enables downloading and updating daily Total Return Index (`TRI`) data for all equity indices.
* Fetches closing values for both `Price` (excluding dividend reinvestment) and `TRI` for all equity indices.
* Identifies key turning points in consecutive corrections and recoveries over the historical values of an index.


## Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
    
* Calculates CAGR for both `Price` and `TRI` indices since the inception.
* Compare CAGR (%) between `Price` and `TRI` indices.
* Sorts `Price` and `TRI` indices by CAGR (%) values.
* Sorts `Price` and `TRI` indices by CAGR (%) within each category.
* Compares the year-wise CAGR (%) and growth of a fixed yearly investment across multiple `TRI` indices.

    
## Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)
    
* Computes the year-wise SIP return for a fixed monthly contribution to a specified `TRI` index. 
* Calculates the closing summary of an SIP with a fixed monthly contribution to a specified `TRI` index, starting from a given date.
* Compares the year-wise XIRR (%) and growth of a fixed monthly SIP investment across multiple `TRI` indices.
* Estimates annual SIP performance, including investment amount, closing balance, and cumulative growth over a specified number of years and expected annual return, with options for yearly, quarterly, monthly, or weekly contributions.



## Visualization

* Displays bar graphs of `Price` and `TRI` index closing values with descending CAGR (%) since inception, both overall and by index category.
* Shows bar graphs of top-performing `Price` and `TRI` indices by CAGR (%) since launch, with options to view a specified number of top indices, either overall or within each category.
* Depicts a bar graph of year-wise investments and returns for a monthly SIP of 1,000 Rupees in a specified `TRI` index since its inception.
* Provides a return comparison between a specified index and government bonds for a monthly SIP of 1,000 Rupees over the years.
* Illustrates a line plot comparing the growth of a monthly SIP investment across multiple NSE equity `TRI` indices over the years.




# Example Insights
Using `BharatFinTrack`, you can quickly gain insights into the performance of equity indices. For instance, the following bar plot highlights the top five equity indices by `TRI` CAGR (%) within each category since their respective launches. This snapshot provides a powerful visual overview of long-term performance trends of investment multiples (X) across different index categories over the years. Because performance data updates daily with each trading session, you can replicate and customize this analysis to generate up-to-date insights tailored to your research needs or investment strategies.

![Category-wise Top Five TRI CAGR(%) of NSE Equity Indices](https://github.com/debpal/BharatFinTrack/raw/main/docs/_static/tri_top_cagr_by_category.png)

In the above graph, the `NIFTY MIDCAP150 MOMENTUM 50` emerges as one of the best-performing NSE equity `TRI` indices in terms of long-term CAGR. The next graph illustrates a comparison of year-wise investments and returns for a monthly SIP of 1,000 Rupees between a government bond and a passive fund tracking the `TRI` data of `NIFTY MIDCAP150 MOMENTUM 50`.

Additionally, the following plot compares the growth multiples (X) of a monthly SIP investment across `TRI` indices, including the popular index `NIFTY 50` and other top-performing NSE equity indices over the years.
