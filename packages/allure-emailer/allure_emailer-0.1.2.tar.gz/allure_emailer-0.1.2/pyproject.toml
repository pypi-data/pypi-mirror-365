## pyproject.toml
#
# This file defines the packaging configuration for the allure-emailer
# project.  It uses the PEP 517/518 build specification with
# setuptools as the build backend.  The project metadata includes
# a description, required Python version and its runtime
# dependencies.  When installing this package the entry point
# declared under [project.scripts] exposes the `allure-emailer`
# executable which runs the Typer-based CLI defined in
# ``src/allure_emailer/cli.py``.
