This favor was attributed by Pope St. Pius V to the recitation of the Holy Rosary. The Blessed Virgin Mary has revealed in numerous apparitions that the Rosary is her favorite prayer. The Popes and many saints have recommended the recital of the Rosary as well. The elements of the Holy Rosary are two: the meditation of the mysteries and the vocal prayer.",

This marked a significant milestone in the juridical development of the Work, affirming that nothing stood in the way of its formal establishment in the Church. From the earliest days, St. Josemaría had prayed earnestly for a juridical path that would preserve the foundational charism he had received. The \"nihil obstat\" was a quiet but decisive answer to those prayers.",
