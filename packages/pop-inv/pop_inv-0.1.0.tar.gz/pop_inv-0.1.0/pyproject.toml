## pyproject.toml
##
## This file contains the metadata necessary for packaging the POP project
## as a Python distribution.  The project is built using setuptools and
## is configured to expose the topâ€‘level modules directly (CartPolar.py,
## Legendre.py, POP.py, Projection.py and Quadrant.py).
## Including RBFs512.pkl and img.pkl as package data ensures that
## the inversion data files are installed alongside.
