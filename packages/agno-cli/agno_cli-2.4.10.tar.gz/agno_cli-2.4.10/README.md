```




## ⚙️ Configuration

Agno CLI Enhanced is highly configurable, allowing you to tailor its behavior to your specific needs, including API key management and model selection. Configuration settings are managed through the `agno configure` command.

### Initial Setup

To begin, you'll need to configure your API keys for the AI providers you intend to use. The CLI supports various providers, including Anthropic and OpenAI.

```bash
# Configure API keys and model settings for Anthropic
agno configure --provider anthropic --api-key your-api-key
agno configure --model claude-3-5-sonnet-20240229

# Alternatively, configure for OpenAI
agno configure --provider openai --api-key your-openai-key
agno configure --model gpt-4

# View your current configuration settings
agno configure --show
```

### Environment Variables

For persistent configuration and to avoid embedding sensitive information directly in scripts, you can set API keys and other settings as environment variables. Agno CLI will automatically detect and utilize these variables.

```bash
# Set your Anthropic API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key"

# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"

# Customize the configuration directory (optional)
export AGNO_CONFIG_DIR="~/.agno_cli"
```

##### Task Persistence and State Management

Agno CLI's team system is designed for robustness, automatically persisting critical information across CLI sessions. This ensures continuity and reliability for long-running tasks.

```bash
# The team system automatically persists:
# - Team activation status (whether the team is active or inactive)
# - Assigned tasks and their current status (pending, in progress, completed)
# - Agent states and their defined capabilities
# - The complete history of task execution

# Example: A long-running task persists even if the CLI session is closed
agno team --activate
agno team --task "Long-running analysis task" --priority normal
agno team --status

# You can exit the CLI and return later; the task will still be present
# (Simulate exiting and re-opening CLI)
# agno team --status  # This command would show the same pending task

# The team activation status also persists across sessions
# (Simulate exiting and re-opening CLI)
# agno team --status  # This command would show the team is still active

# Deactivate the team when the task is finally done
agno team --deactivate
```

### Search Operations

Leverage Agno CLI's search capabilities to quickly find information across multiple search engines:

```bash
# Perform a basic search query
agno search "artificial intelligence trends 2024"

# Execute a multi-engine search and format the output as Markdown
agno search "climate change solutions" --multi --format markdown

# Perform a search using a specific engine (DuckDuckGo) and limit results to 5
agno search "python best practices" --engine duckduckgo --num 5
```

### Financial Analysis

Access real-time financial data and perform analyses directly from the terminal:

```bash
# Get detailed information about a specific stock (e.g., Apple - AAPL)
agno finance AAPL --action info

# Retrieve the latest news related to a company (e.g., Tesla - TSLA)
agno finance TSLA --action news

# Analyze the historical performance of a stock over a specified period (e.g., Microsoft - MSFT over 2 years)
agno finance MSFT --action analysis --period 2y

# Get a summary of the current market conditions
agno finance --summary
```

### Mathematical Calculations

```bash
# Execute a basic mathematical calculation
agno calc "2^10 + sqrt(144)"

# Solve an equation and display the step-by-step solution
agno calc "solve: 2x + 5 = 13" --steps

# Define a variable for use in subsequent calculations
agno calc --var "x=10"

# Perform a calculation using previously defined variables
agno calc "3*x + 2*x^2"

# List all currently defined variables
agno calc --list-vars
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

### File System Operations

```bash
# Issue: Read command not showing output
# Solution: Use --format text or --format json explicitly
agno files --read file.txt --format text

# Issue: DateTime serialization errors
# Solution: Fixed in latest version - datetime objects are properly handled

# Issue: Permission denied errors
# Solution: Check file permissions and ensure safe path operations
agno files --info file.txt  # Check file permissions first
```

### Agent Operations

```bash
# Issue: UnboundLocalError with multi_agent_system
# Solution: Fixed in latest version - proper initialization handling

# Issue: Agent state not loading correctly
# Solution: Check agents_state_agents.json and agents_state_orchestrator.json files
ls -la agents_state*.json  # Verify state files exist
```

### Chat Operations

```bash
# Issue: TypeError with RunResponse objects
# Solution: Fixed in latest version - proper content extraction from RunResponse

# Issue: Markdown rendering errors
# Solution: Ensure content is string type before passing to Markdown()
```

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check CLI installation
which agno
agno --version

# Check Python environment
python --version
pip list | grep agno

# Test file system tools directly
python -c "
from agno_cli.tools.file_system_tools import FileSystemToolsManager
fs = FileSystemToolsManager()
fs.list_directory()
"

# Check configuration
agno configure --show
```

### Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paulgg-code/agno-cli.git
cd agno-cli
pip install -e .[dev]
pre-commit install
```

### Development Workflow Example

### File System Tool Development Commands Used

```bash
# Initial testing and debugging
agno files --list                                    # Test basic listing
agno files --read README.md                          # Test file reading (initially failed)
agno files --read README.md --format text            # Test with explicit format
agno files --read README.md --format json            # Test JSON output

# Debug commands used during development
python -c "from agno_cli.tools.file_system_tools import FileSystemToolsManager; fs = FileSystemToolsManager(); fs.list_directory()"
python -c "from agno_cli.tools.file_system_tools import FileSystemTools; fs = FileSystemTools(); result = fs.read_file('README.md'); print(result.success)"

# Testing all file operations
agno files --write test.txt --content "Hello World"  # Test file writing
agno files --read test.txt                           # Test reading written file
agno files --info test.txt                           # Test file info
agno files --search "*.txt"                          # Test file search
agno files --mkdir test_dir                          # Test directory creation
agno files --copy test.txt:test_dir/copy.txt         # Test file copying
agno files --move test.txt:renamed.txt               # Test file moving
agno files --delete renamed.txt --no-confirm         # Test file deletion
agno files --delete test_dir --recursive --no-confirm # Test directory deletion
agno files --tree                                    # Test tree view
agno files --tree --hidden                           # Test tree with hidden files

# Help and documentation testing
agno --help                                          # Test main help
agno files --help                                    # Test file system help
```

```bash
# 1. Set up development environment
pyenv activate agnocli2@virtuelenv
pip install -e .

# 2. Test current functionality
agno --help
agno files --help

# 3. Implement new feature (example: file system tools)
# Edit agno_cli/tools/file_system_tools.py
# Edit agno_cli/cli.py to add new commands

# 4. Test the implementation
agno files --list
agno files --read README.md
agno files --write test.txt --content "test"

# 5. Debug issues (if any)
# Add debug output, test, remove debug output
python -c "from agno_cli.tools.file_system_tools import FileSystemToolsManager; fs = FileSystemToolsManager(); fs.list_directory()"

# 6. Update documentation
# Edit README.md with new commands and examples

# 7. Test all functionality
agno files --list --hidden --recursive
agno files --read README.md --format json
agno files --tree
```
