Welcome to sl-experiment API documentation page
===============================================

sl-experiment is a Python library that provides tools to acquire, manage, and preprocess scientific data in the Sun
(NeuroAI) lab.

This library uses tools released as part of the 'Ataraxis' science-automation project, developed in the
`Sun lab <https://neuroai.github.io/sunlab/>`_ at Cornell University. The main purpose of this library is to specialize
the context-agnostic Ataraxis tools to work for the specific runtime context(s) in the Sun lab. It works as the central
hub for all data acquisition and preprocessing tools used by all projects in the lab.

This website only contains the API documentation for the classes and methods offered by this library. See the project
GitHub repository for installation instructions and additional library usage details:
