    This is a worker function called by the process_mesoscope_directory in-parallel for each stack inside each
    processed directory. It re-compresses the input TIFF stack using LERC-compression and extracts the frame-variant
    ScanImage metadata for each frame inside the stack. Optionally, the function can be configured to verify data
    integrity after compression.

    Notes:
        This function can reserve up to double the processed stack size of RAM bytes to hold the data in memory. If the
        host-computer does not have enough RAM, reduce the number of concurrent processes, reduce the batch size, or
        disable verification.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If any extracted frame does not match the original frame stored inside the TIFF stack.

        first_frame_number: The position (number) of the first frame stored in the stack, relative to the overall

            the range of frames stored in the stack.
        output_directory: The path to the directory where to save the processed stacks.
        verify_integrity: Determines whether to verify the integrity of compressed data against the source data.
            The conversion does not alter the source data, so it is usually safe to disable this option, as the chance
            of compromising the data is negligible. Note, enabling this function doubles the RAM usage for each worker
            process.
        batch_size: The number of frames to process at the same time. This directly determines the RAM footprint of
            this function, as frames are kept in RAM during compression. Note, verification doubles the RAM footprint,
            as it requires both compressed and uncompressed data to be kept in RAM for comparison.

    """Loops over all multi-frame Mesoscope TIFF stacks acquired for the session, recompresses them using the Limited
    Error Raster Compression (LERC) scheme, and extracts ScanImage metadata.

    This function is used as a preprocessing step for mesoscope-acquired data that optimizes the size of raw images for
    long-term storage and streaming over the network. To do so, all stacks are re-encoded using LERC scheme, which
    achieves ~70% compression ratio, compared to the original frame stacks obtained from the mesoscope. Additionally,
    this function also extracts frame-variant and frame-invariant ScanImage metadata from raw stacks and saves it as
    efficiently encoded JSON (.json) and compressed numpy archive (.npz) files to minimize disk space usage.

    Notes:
        This function is specifically calibrated to work with TIFF stacks produced by the ScanImage matlab software.
        Critically, these stacks are named using '_' to separate acquisition and stack number from the rest of the
        file name, and the stack number is always found last, e.g.: 'Tyche-A7_2022_01_25_1_00001_00067.tif'. If the
        input TIFF files do not follow this naming convention, the function will not process them. Similarly, if the
        stacks do not contain ScanImage metadata, they will be excluded from processing.

        To optimize runtime efficiency, this function employs multiple processes to work with multiple TIFFs at the
        same time. Given the overall size of each image dataset, this function can run out of RAM if it is allowed to
        operate on the entire folder at the same time. To prevent this, disable verification, use fewer processes, or
        change the batch_size to load fewer frames in memory at the same time.

        In addition to frame compression and data extraction, this function also generates the ops.json configuration
        file. This file is used during suite2p cell registration, performed as part of our standard data processing
        pipeline.

        This function is purposefully designed to collapse data from multiple acquisitions stored inside the same
        directory into the same frame volume. This implementation was chosen based on the specific patterns of data
        acquisition in the Sun lab, where all data acquired for a single session is necessarily expected to belong to
        the same acquisition.

    Args:
        session_data: The SessionData instance for the processed session.
        num_processes: The maximum number of processes to use while processing the directory. Each process is used to
            compress a stack of TIFF files in parallel.
        remove_sources: Determines whether to remove the original TIFF files after they have been processed.
        batch: Determines whether the function is called as part of batch-processing multiple directories. This is used
            to optimize progress reporting to avoid cluttering the terminal window.
        verify_integrity: Determines whether to verify the integrity of compressed data against the source data.
            The conversion does not alter the source data, so it is usually safe to disable this option, as the chance
            of compromising the data is negligible. Note, enabling this function doubles the RAM used by each parallel
            worker spawned by this function.
        batch_size: Determines how many frames are loaded into memory at the same time during processing. Note, the same
            number of frames will be loaded from each stack processed in parallel.
