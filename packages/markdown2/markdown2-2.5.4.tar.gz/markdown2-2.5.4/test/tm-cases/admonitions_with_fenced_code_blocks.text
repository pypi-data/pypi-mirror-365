.. note::
   Admonitions are able to contain fenced code blocks
   ```python
   print('like so')
   ```

.. warning::
   ```python
   print('Consecutive blocks should also be fine')
   ```
   ```python
   print('Even though fenced code blocks wrap themselves in newlines')
   ```
   .. hint:: It should also work nested
      ```python
      print('ok')
      ```

```python
# admonitions WITHIN fenced code blocks should NOT be rendered
.. attention:: title
   body
```
