## Simple Test
Inline Equations can be written as $y=mx+b$.
Block equations are wrapped using
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$
This code block will not have the math rendered.
```
some random code, describing $a and $b will not be rendered, $y=mx$ 
```
This will not work either `$\sqrt{2}` or

```
$$
f = 12
$$
```
