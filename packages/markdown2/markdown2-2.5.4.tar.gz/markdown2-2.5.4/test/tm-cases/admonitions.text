.. NOTE:: Admonitions
   They contain 3 main parts, the admonition type, title and body.  

   The admonition type is case insensitive, title is optional and the body
   should be able to contain pretty much anything. For example:

   - Lists
   - With multiple levels
     - Of indentation

   And code blocks:

       print('indented code blocks')

.. warning::
   The admonition's body must be indented by a tab or 3 or more spaces
   from where the admonition was declared
  Otherwise the text is no longer part of the admonition.

.. IMPORTANT::
   You can also use 3 or more empty lines after an admonition  
   to end it



    print('In case you wanted something like')
    print('an indented code block right after')

.. admonition:: Generic admonitions

   These should be given a title but this is not enforced

   .. note:: Nested admonitions
      Nested admonitions should also work

      - Even inside
