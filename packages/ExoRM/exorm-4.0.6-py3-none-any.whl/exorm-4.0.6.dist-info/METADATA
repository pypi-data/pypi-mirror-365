# ExoRM

`ExoRM` is a model for the mass of an exoplanet given the radius.

Note that the development is tricky; from this package's development, it seems that Chen & Kipping's `forecaster` is suitable for the limited needs.

## Features

- continuous radius-mass relationship
- smooth
- simple usage, log10 and linear
- method to create your own model, existing model provided

## Installation

To install `ExoRM`, use pip: ```pip install ExoRM```.

However, many prefer to use a virtual environment (or any of their preferred choice).

macOS / Linux:

```sh
# make your desired directory
mkdir /path/to/your/directory
cd /path/to/your/directory

# setup the .venv (or whatever you want to name it)
pip install virtualenv
python3 -m venv .venv

# install ExoRM
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install ExoRM

deactivate # when you are completely done
```

Windows CMD:

```sh
# make your desired directory
mkdir C:path\to\your\directory
cd C:path\to\your\directory

# setup the .venv (or whatever you want to name it)
pip install virtualenv
python3 -m venv .venv

# install ExoRM
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install ExoRM

deactivate # when you are completely done
```

## Usage

To first begin using ExoRM, the data and model must be initialized. This is due to the constant discovery of new exoplanets, adding to the data. You may also call these at any time to update the model.

There is an existing model created in `best_inputs.pkl` and `best_trace.nc`, simply provide these paths when you are using to avoid creating your own model.

However, to get your own data and create your own model, simply run `get_data()` and `initialize_model()`. Note: import those by using `from ExoRM.get_data import get_data()` and `from ExoRM.initialize_model() import initialize_model()`. A plot of the model will be shown for you to see. Both are stored in your OS's Application Data for ExoRM. ExoRM provides built in functions to retrieve from this folder.

Usage of the model requires initializiation of the class and loading of the trace from a .nc file.

Note that all files saved are located in `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/ExoRM` for macOS and `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\ExoRM\ExoRM` for windows.

The model supports log10 and linear scale in earth radii. When using the `model([...]), .__call__([...]), or .predict([...])`, the log10 scale is used. Linear predictions are used in `.predict_linear([...])`.

Uncertainty (upper and lower bounds) can be accessed from `predict_full` and `predict_full_liner`.

An example is seen in the `example.ipynb`. Deep analysis is seen in `comparison.ipynb`, showing statistical results and a comparison with Forecaster. Those use additional libraries for visualization and statistics (seaborn and SciPy).

## Additional notes

ExoRM has an implementation of Forecaster for according to the NASA Exoplanet Archive.
