# Model Card for {repo_id}

This model was created using the [pruna](https://github.com/PrunaAI/pruna) library. Pruna is a model optimization framework built for developers, enabling you to deliver more efficient models with minimal implementation overhead.

## Usage

First things first, you need to install the pruna library:

```bash
pip install {pruna_library}
```

You can [use the {library_name} library to load the model](https://huggingface.co/{repo_id}?library={library_name}) but this might not include all optimizations by default.

To ensure that all optimizations are applied, use the pruna library to load the model using the following code:

```python
from {pruna_library} import {pruna_model_class}

loaded_model = {pruna_model_class}.from_hub(
    "{repo_id}"
)
```

After loading the model, you can use the inference methods of the original model. Take a look at the [documentation](https://pruna.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for more usage information.

## Smash Configuration

The compression configuration of the model is stored in the `smash_config.json` file, which describes the optimization methods that were applied to the model.

```bash
{smash_config}
```
