Welcome to ~TiddlyZettelKasten, usually known as ''tzk'' (pronounced /tə'ziːk/, tuh-ZEEK). tzk is an occasionally updated version of [[Soren's Zettelkasten|https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com]] in a format that you can use as a launching point for your own Zettelkasten or similar wiki.

You are expected and encouraged to make tzk your own by changing its conventions, tools, tags, and so on as you learn more about the Zettelkasten approach to note-taking. Rather than a full-service application, tzk is a framework you can use to build your own system (although it works out of the box if you happen to like Soren's highly opinionated approach).

It's recommended that you have a basic understanding of TiddlyWiki before getting started with tzk. [[Grok TiddlyWiki|https://groktiddlywiki.com]] is a free online textbook you can use to learn TiddlyWiki; completing at least chapters 1 and 2 is recommended before getting too serious with tzk. (Jumping in first is totally fine, but if you find yourself with lots of questions about how things work, check //Grok ~TiddlyWiki// before getting frustrated).

If you're viewing this page on the web, you have two options for installation:

<$details summary="As a single file">

You can start out by downloading the wiki as a single HTML file and working with it directly in your browser:

{{$:/snippets/download-wiki-button}}

You will need a way of saving changes to this file as you work. You can [[view the full list of options at tiddlywiki.com|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Saving]]; if you've never used TiddlyWiki before and aren't sure what to pick, [[I recommend TiddlyDesktop|https://groktiddlywiki.com/read/#Installing%20TiddlyWiki]].

You can always convert your single-file wiki to Node.js later using the `tzk convert` command.

<$details summary="Through Node.js (full-service)">

tzk is primarily designed for use with Node.js and has an associated helper command-line interface. Using tzk this way is more involved and technical but offers the following features you can't get in the single-file version:

* Instant setup of your wiki on Node.js.
* Highly configurable builds, allowing you to publish different versions of your wiki -- a common use case is publishing some of your content on the web and keeping some of it private.
* Space-efficient backups and version history with Git.

Full instructions for installing and initializing the tzk command-line tool can be [[found on Read the Docs|https://tzk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/]].

If you're familiar with command-line tools like tzk, you can get a quick start by making sure you have Git, NPM, and Python 3.6 or greater installed, then running:

```
$ pip install tzk
$ mkdir my_wiki_folder
$ cd my_wiki_folder
$ tzk init
$ tzk listen
```

If everything goes well, this will launch a web server and tell you what URL to enter into your web browser, and when you go there you'll have your wiki waiting for you.

Once you have a copy of tzk, open it up on your computer and get started with the following quick-start wizard!
