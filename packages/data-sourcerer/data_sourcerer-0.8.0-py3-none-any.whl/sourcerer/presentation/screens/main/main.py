    A Textual application for managing cloud storage credentials and content.

    This application provides a user interface to list and manage cloud storage
    credentials, view storage content, and handle storage item selection. It
    integrates with various cloud storage providers and supports asynchronous
    operations for fetching and displaying storage data.

    Attributes:
        CSS_PATH (str): Path to the CSS file for styling the application.
        BINDINGS (list): Key bindings for application actions.
        is_storage_list_loading (reactive): Reactive attribute indicating if the
            storage list is currently loading.

    Methods:
        compose() -> ComposeResult: Composes the UI layout with storage list and
            content areas.
        on_mount(): Initializes the application theme and storage list on mount.
        action_credentials_list(): Opens the credentials list screen and refreshes
            storages.
        refresh_storages(*args, **kwargs): Refreshes the storage list by clearing
            and reinitializing it.
        init_storages_list() -> None: Asynchronously initializes the storage list
            by fetching and displaying storages.
