# **Chapter 3: Basic Usage**

## **Creating and Setting Up the Model**

This chapter explains how to create the thermodynamic model, define state points, and add components like pumps, turbines, and heat exchangers to simulate thermodynamic systems.

### **1\. The `Prop()` Function**

Before defining state points, let’s understand the **`Prop()`** function, as it is used to calculate and create the thermodynamic state for fluids.  **`Prop()`** is using coolprop for calculating the thermodynamic properties. The **`Prop()`** function returns an object (called `State`) that holds the thermodynamic properties of the fluid at a specific state point.

Here’s how the **`Prop()`** function works:

`State = model.Prop(fluid, StatePointName, Mass_flowrate=None, **properties)`

### **Arguments for the `Prop()` function:**

* **fluid**: The fluid type (e.g., 'water', 'isobutane').

* **StatePointName**: A unique identifier for the state point (e.g., '1', '2').

* **Mass\_flowrate** (optional): The mass flow rate of the fluid at the state point (in kg/s).

* **\*\*properties**: These are the thermodynamic properties to define the state point, such as:

  * **P**: Pressure at the state point (in Pascals).  
  * **T**: Temperature at the state point (in Kelvin).  
  * **H**: Enthalpy at the state point (in J/kg).  
  * **S**: Entropy at the state point (in J/kg·K).  
  * **Q**: Quality of the fluid (used in two-phase fluids)  
  * **State.D**: Density (in kg/m³)

#### **State Object**

The **`Prop()`** function creates a **State** object that holds the thermodynamic properties of the fluid. You can access or update the properties of this object directly.

* **State.T**: Temperature (in Kelvin)

* **State.P**: Pressure (in Pascals)

* **State.H**: Enthalpy (in J/kg)

* **State.S**: Entropy (in J/kg·K)

* **State.D**: Density (in kg/m³)

* **State.Cp**: Specific heat at constant pressure (in J/kg·K)

### **Example Usage of `Prop()` and Accessing Properties:**
```python
# Define a state point for water
State = model.Prop('water', 'Demo', P=6.09e5, T=158 + 273.15)

# Print all properties of the State object
print(State)  # This will display the State object's properties like T, P, H, etc.

# Update the pressure directly
State.P = 7e5  # New pressure in Pascals

# Print updated State object to check changes
print(State)  # The updated properties will be displayed
```
In this example:

* **State** is an object that stores all the thermodynamic properties for the fluid at state point 'Demo’'.

* We can access the temperature, pressure, enthalpy, entropy, density, and specific heat directly using `State.T`, `State.P`, `State.H`, `State.S`, `State.D`, and `State.Cp`, respectively.

* We update the pressure of the state point using **`State.P = 7e5`**.

### **2\. Adding State Point to the Model**

State points represent the thermodynamic conditions (like pressure, temperature, and mass flow rate) at different points in the system. These points are added using the **`add_point()`** method, which internally calls the **`Prop()`** function to calculate and store the properties of the fluid.

#### **Adding State Points**

When adding a state point, you can define only the known parameters (e.g., pressure, temperature etc.) . The missing properties will be calculated by the model based on the provided values.

```python
# Adding a state point for water with a known pressure only

model.add_point('water', StatePointName='1', P=6.09e5, T= 180+273.15, Mass_flowrate=None)

print(model.Points['1'])
```
In this example:

* **'water'** is the fluid.

* **StatePointName='1'** is the unique identifier for the state point.

* **P=6.09e5** sets the pressure.

* **T=180+273.15** sets the themperature.

* **Mass\_flowrate=None** indicates that the mass flow rate is not specified and can be calculated.

You can also set  parameters like pressure (**P**), Temperature (**T**), enthalpy (**H**), entropy (**S**), quality (**Q**), and density (**D**) to `None`:

```python
# Adding a state point for water with a known pressure only

model.add_point('water', StatePointName='1', P=6.09e5, T= None, Mass_flowrate=None)

print(model.Points['1'])
```
Here you can see that the state point '1' is added to the model but properties are not calculated as the sufficient numbers of parameters are not given.


#### **State Points in the Model**

All the state points you add are stored in **`model.Point`**. You can access each state point by its **StatePointName** and view or update its properties.
```python
# Access a state point by its name (e.g., '1')
State = model.Point['1']

# Print the properties of the state point
print(State)
```
### **3\. Updating State Points**

You can also update the properties of any state point after it has been created. For example, to update the pressure of state point '1', you can do:
```
# Update the pressure of state point '1'
model.Point['1'].P = 7e5  # Update pressure to 7e5 Pascals

# Print the updated state point to verify the change
print(model.Point['1'])
```
### 4\. Displaying All State Points

To view all state points and their properties, you can use the model.Point_print() method:
```
# Print all state points in the model
model.Point_print()
```
This will display all the state points and their corresponding properties (e.g., temperature, pressure, enthalpy, density, etc.) and it will return a pandas data frame which contain the proparties of the state points.

# **Chapter 4: Model Components**

In this chapter, we will explore the key components of the thermodynamic model, such as pumps, turbines, heat exchangers,pipe, expansion Valve and other elements that modify the properties of fluids as they flow through the system. Each component plays a significant role in simulating the energy transfers and thermodynamic processes of the system.

## **1. Turbine**
The **Turbine** component in the **ThermoSim** module models the process of energy extraction from a fluid as it flows through the turbine. A turbine reduces the pressure of the fluid and extracts work, which is useful in power generation, refrigeration, and other thermodynamic cycles.

### **Functionality**

* The **Turbine** takes fluid from an **inlet state** and delivers it to an **outlet state**.

* The turbine extracts energy from the fluid and reduces its pressure.

* The **isentropic efficiency** (`n_isen`) and **mechanical efficiency** ('n_mech') are used to simulate real-world behavior of the turbine, considering energy losses.

* The turbine calculates missing state properties (like temperature, enthalpy) based on the known inlet/outlet conditions.

---

## **Constructor and Arguments**

---

## **The `Calc()` Method**

1. **Mass Flow Rate Check**:

   * If the mass flow rate is not specified at either the inlet or outlet, it is inferred from the known state. If both are provided, they must match.

2. **Pressure Drop**:

   * If the inlet pressure is not specified, it is calculated by adding the **pressure drop** to the outlet pressure.

   * If the outlet pressure is not specified, it is calculated by subtracting the **pressure drop** from the inlet pressure.

3. **Temperature Drop**:

   * Similar to the pressure drop, if the temperature at either the inlet or outlet is unknown, it is calculated based on the **temperature drop**.

4. **Solution Status**:

   * After the calculations, the solution status is updated, and the model’s state points are updated.

## **Key Notes**
* For all cases counter-flow heat exchanger is considered.
* Mass flow rates must be provided for either the hot or cold fluids. If one is missing, it will be inferred from the other sufficient parameters are given.  
* The PPT (Pinch Point Temperature) is critical for determining the minimum temperature difference between the hot and cold fluids. it acts as a constrain.  
* The effectiveness of the heat exchanger should be provided if the energy balance requires it (e.g., for counter-flow heat exchangers).  
* Plotting can be enabled by setting `PPT_graph=True`, which will display the temperature profiles for both the hot and cold fluids.

The `HEX_type` argument defines the type of heat exchanger being modeled. It plays a crucial role in determining the heat transfer characteristics and the method used to calculate the heat exchange between the hot and cold fluids.

### **Available Types of Heat Exchanger**

The `HEX_type` argument can take various values, including common configurations like `'double_pipe'`, `'Evaporator'`, and `'Condenser'`. Each type represents a specific kind of heat exchanger, and the calculation methods and assumptions may vary based on the selected type.

### **1\.** `'double_pipe'` 

* Description: A double-pipe heat exchanger consists of two concentric pipes, with one fluid flowing through the inner pipe and the other fluid flowing through the outer pipe. This type is used for small heat exchange applications, especially when space is limited.  
* Heat Transfer Mechanism: Heat is transferred between the two fluids through the pipe walls, relying on a temperature gradient between the fluids.  
* Calculation: The model uses a simple approach for calculating the heat transfer between the two streams based on the temperature difference and flow rates.
* Here no phase change occure in any fluid.  
* Example Usage:  

---

### **2\.** `'Evaporator'` 

* Description: The cold fluid changes phase from liquid to gas in the process.  (e.g., Evaporator, Boiler)
* Heat Transfer Mechanism: Heat is transferred from the hot fluid to the cold fluid, causing it to evaporate. 

---

### **3\.** `'Condenser'`

* Description: A condenser heat exchanger is used to reject heat from hot fluid (e.g., steam) to a cold fluid (e.g., water or air), causing the vapor to condense into a liquid.  
* Heat Transfer Mechanism: In a condenser, the hot vapor loses its heat to the cooling fluid, which causes the vapor to condense. This type of heat exchanger is used in power plants, refrigeration systems, and air conditioning.  

---

### **4\.** `'SimpleHEX'` **Heat Exchanger**

* Description: A simple heat exchanger can represent a variety of heat exchangers that do not fall into more specific categories. It's often used as a generic heat exchanger model for educational or testing purposes.  
* Heat Transfer Mechanism: This model uses a simplified approach to calculate heat transfer based on temperature differences and flow rates.
* This heat exchanger can be used where only one fluid is considered. For example we know the feed water inlet state of a boiler and heat transfer to the boiler, then it will calculate the outlet state. here we will provide the only cold fluid inlet state no need to provide the hot fluid info.

* Example Usage:

# PCM (Phase Change Material) 


The `PCM` component models a **phase change material energy storage system** that exchanges heat with two fluid streams — one for charging and one for discharging. It is designed to simulate how thermal energy is **stored during melting (charging)** and **released during solidification (discharging)** at a constant melting temperature.

This component is especially useful for modeling **thermal energy storage** systems used in renewable energy integration, waste heat recovery, or HVAC load balancing.

# Example problem
A geothermal Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) system uses isobutane as the working fluid and water as the heating source. Hot water enters the evaporator at 158°C and 600 kPa, with a mass flow rate of 500 kg/s, and exits at a restricted temperature of 90°C. The working fluid, isobutane, evaporates at a pressure of 3250 kPa and condenses at 410 kPa. Cooling is provided by ambient air entering the condenser at 3°C with a mass flow rate of 8500 kg/s. You are required to model the thermodynamic performance of the cycle: 

* Estimate the maximum isobutane flow rate based on heat availability, 
* Turbine and pump work,
* Efficiency of the cycle

![Schematic Diagrame](diagrame.png "Schematic Diagrame of the ORC plant")

## Solution:
First, we will set the known parameters
```
import ThermoSim
Model = ThermoSim.ThermodynamicModel()

    
T1 = 158+273.15 # Hot Water Inlet temperature
T2 = 90+273.15 # Hot water outlet 
T3 = None
T4 = None
T5 = None
T6 = None
T7 = 3 + 273.15 # Air temperature
T8 = None


P1 = 6e5 #Hot Water Inlet Pressure
P2 = None
P3 = 3250e3 # Turbine Inlet Pressure
P4 = 410e3  # Turbine Outlet Pressure
P5 = None
P6 = None
P7 = 1.01e5 # Atmospheric Pressure
P8 = None


m_brine = 500
water = 'water'
w_fluid = 'Isobutane'
cooling_fluid = 'Air'
m_air = 8500
```
Now we make some assumptions and try to find other parameters.
```
#Assumptions
# No Pressure drop in HEX so
P2 = P1 # Eveporator: Hot side pressure of inlet and outlet is same
P5 = P4 # Eveporatore: cold side pressure of inlet and outlet is same
P6 = P3 # Condenser: Hot side pressure of inlet and outlet is same
P8 = P7 # Condenser: cold side pressure of inlet and outlet is same

# Consider 10K superheat for working fluid at evaporator outlet
T3 = Model.Prop(w_fluid, StatePointName = "demo", P = P3,Q = 1).T+10
# Consider 20K subcooling of working fluid at condenser outlet
T5 = Model.Prop(w_fluid,StatePointName="xxx",P = P5,Q = 0).T - 20

# Consider Pump and Turbines Isentropic efficiency
n_expn = .75
n_pump = 0.75
PPT = 5
```
Now we add the state points to our model. 
```

Model.add_point(water, StatePointName = '1',P = P1, T = T1,Mass_flowrate=m_brine)
Model.add_point(water, StatePointName = '2',P = P2, T = T2)
Model.add_point(w_fluid, StatePointName = '3',P = P3, T = T3)
Model.add_point(w_fluid, StatePointName = '4',P = P4, T = T4)
Model.add_point(w_fluid, StatePointName = '5',P = P5, T = T5)
Model.add_point(w_fluid, StatePointName = '6',P = P6, T = T6)
Model.add_point(cooling_fluid, StatePointName = '7',P = P7, T = T7,Mass_flowrate=m_air)
Model.add_point(cooling_fluid, StatePointName = '8',P = P8, T = T8)
Model.Point_print()
```
Massflowrate of the working fluid is unknown so mass flowrate at state point 5 and 6 is set to 1 kg/s. It will show a warnig massage. As soon as we calculate the mass flowrate of the working fluid, we will recalculate the pump.
```
Pump = Model.Pump(Model, 'Pump', In_state = '5', Out_state = '6',n_isen=n_pump,Calculate=True)
```
Now solve the evaporator. Here, only missing paramtere is working fluids mass flow rate. 
```
Evaporator = Model.HeatExchanger(Model, 'Evaporator', PPT = PPT, HEX_type = 'Evaporator', Hot_In_state = '1', Hot_Out_state = '2', Cold_In_state = '6', Cold_Out_state = '3',Calculate=True,PPT_graph=True)
```
As we know the mass flow rate of the working fluid, we recalculate the pump for accurate power of the pump.
```
Pump.Cal()
```
Now we solve the turbine and the condenser.
```
Turbine = Model.Turbine(Model, 'Turbine', In_state = '3', Out_state = '4',n_isen=n_expn,Calculate=True)


Condenser =  Model.HeatExchanger(Model, 'Condenser', PPT = PPT, HEX_type = 'Condenser', Hot_In_state = '4', Hot_Out_state = '5', Cold_In_state = '7', Cold_Out_state = '8',Calculate=True,PPT_graph=True)
Model.Point_print()
```
You can print all the component and state point by using the following command.
```
print(Model)
```
Now we can calculate and print the required parameters
```
working_fluid_massflowrate = Evaporator.Cold_Mass_flowrate
Turbine_work = Turbine.work
Pump_work = Pump.work
Q_in = Evaporator.Q
ORC_efficiency = (Turbine_work-Pump_work)/Q_in*100

print(f"Working Fluid's Mass Flowrate: {working_fluid_massflowrate} kg/s")
print(f"Turbine Power: {Turbine_work} W\n"
      f"Pump Power: {Pump_work} W")
print(f"Cycle Efficiency: {ORC_efficiency} %")

```
## Tips
* You can add this `Model.Point_print()` after every component to fidn which state point is solved.
