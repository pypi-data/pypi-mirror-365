# GridStatus.io Hosted API

Python client for accessing the [GridStatus.io Hosted API](https://www.gridstatus.io/api). 

Browse all available datasets in our [Data Catalog](https://www.gridstatus.io/datasets).


## Installation

`gridstatusio` supports Python 3.10+. Install with uv or pip. 

```bash
uv pip install gridstatusio
```

## Getting Started

* Sign up for a Grid Status account and get your API key from the [Settings page](https://www.gridstatus.io/settings/api)
* Set your API key as an environment variable: `export GRIDSTATUS_API_KEY=your_api_key`
* **NOTE**: the Grid Status API has a 1 million rows per month limit on the free plan. This limit is _very_ easy to exceed when querying data, especially real time prices.
  * Make sure to add `limit` to all of your `get_dataset` calls to avoid quickly exceeding the limit.
* The Grid Status API has rate limits that restrict the number of requests that are allowed each second, minute and hour. If rate limits are hit the client will automatically retry the request after a delay. You can configure the maximum number of retries using the `max_retries` parameter when initializing the client. If you find yourself hitting rate limits, you may need to add a delay between your requests. The [Grid Status Pricing Page](https://www.gridstatus.io/pricing) contains more details on specific rate limits.

Then check out this example notebook: [Getting Started](Examples/1.%20Getting%20Started.ipynb)

Other notebooks in the [Examples](Examples) directory:

- [Finding Hubs and Zones in Pricing Data](Examples/2.%20ISO%20Hubs.ipynb)
- [ERCOT Pricing Data](Examples/3.%20ERCOT%20Pricing%20Data.ipynb)
- [CAISO April Net Load Analysis](Examples/4.%20CAISO%20April%20Net%20Load.ipynb)
- [Stacked Net Load Visualization](Examples/5.%20Stacked%20Net%20Load%20Visualization.ipynb)
- [Resample Data to Different Frequencies](Examples/6.%20Resampling%20Data.ipynb)

## Retry Configuration

The client retries failed requests due to rate limits (429), server errors (5xx), and network issues using exponential backoff. You can customize retry behavior:

```python
client = GridStatusClient(
    max_retries=3,        # Maximum retries (default: 5)
    base_delay=1.0,       # Base delay in seconds (default: 2.0)
    exponential_base=1.5, # Exponential backoff multiplier (default: 2.0)
)
```

The retry delay follows the formula `delay = base_delay * (exponential_base ** retry_count)`.

Retries are useful when:

* You're making pagination-heavy requests and risk hitting short-term rate limits
* A request fails due to a temporary server error
* A network issue or timeout interrupts the request

To disable retries entirely, set `max_retries=0`.

## Version Check

The client checks for updates to the library when it is imported. It does this by making a call to the [library on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/gridstatusio/). For certain applications, this call can be problematic, and can be disabled by setting the environment variable `GSIO_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK` to `true`.

```bash
export GSIO_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=true
```

## Open Source

If you prefer to use an open source library that fetches data directly from the source, you can check out this [github repo](https://github.com/gridstatus/gridstatus).
