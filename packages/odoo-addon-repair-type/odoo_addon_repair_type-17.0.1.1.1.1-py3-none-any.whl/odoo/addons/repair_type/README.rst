This module adds support for source locations when adding, removing, or
recycling components. If you specify any of these types in a Repair
Order, Odoo will automatically apply the corresponding locations from
the related stock picking type to the stock moves.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
