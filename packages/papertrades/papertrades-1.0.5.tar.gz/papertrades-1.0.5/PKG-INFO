However, many prefer to use a virtual environment (or any of their preferred choice).

macOS / Linux:

```sh
# make your desired directory
mkdir /path/to/your/directory
cd /path/to/your/directory

# setup the .venv (or whatever you want to name it)
pip install virtualenv
python3 -m venv .venv

# install papertrades
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install papertrades

deactivate # when you are completely done
```

Windows CMD:

```sh
# make your desired directory
mkdir C:path\to\your\directory
cd C:path\to\your\directory

# setup the .venv (or whatever you want to name it)
pip install virtualenv
python3 -m venv .venv

# install papertrades
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install papertrades

deactivate # when you are completely done
```

## Usage

Create a portfolio with a starting balance and a path for its trades.
Once you make trades, you make save the trades to use later, and load them from the portfolio.
See the example for complete functionality with all methods!
