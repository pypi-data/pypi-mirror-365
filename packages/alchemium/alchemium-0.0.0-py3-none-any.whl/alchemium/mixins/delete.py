"""
delete_mixin.py

This module provides a reusable async mixin for safely deleting ORM model instances
within a SQLAlchemy-based repository pattern.

Key features:
    - Ensures model class is defined before deletion.
    - Validates that an instance is passed before attempting delete.
    - Designed to be used inside a Unit of Work that manages commit/rollback.
    - Does NOT commit or flush — responsibility is delegated to UoW/session owner.

Typical usage:
    async with UnitOfWork(...) as uow:
        await SomeRepository.delete(uow.session, some_instance)

    Mixin for deleting ORM model instances with validation.

    This mixin provides a class method for safely deleting SQLAlchemy model instances
    using an asynchronous session, typically within a Unit of Work (UoW) context.

    Features:
        - Validates that a model is defined on the repository.
        - Ensures a valid object is passed for deletion.
        - Does not commit the session — expects a higher-level UoW to handle it.

    Attributes:
        model (Type[T]): The SQLAlchemy ORM model class to be deleted.

        This method performs model and object validation before deletion.
        It does not flush or commit the session — that is the responsibility
