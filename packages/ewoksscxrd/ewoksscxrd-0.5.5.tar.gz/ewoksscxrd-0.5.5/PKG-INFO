# ewoksscxrd

The **ewoksscxrd** project is a Python library designed to provide workflow tasks for Single-Crystal X-Ray Diffraction (SC-XRD) Data Processing using Ewoks (Extensible Workflow System). 

## Installation

By default, at the ESRF, `ewoksscxrd` should be installed on Ewoks workers using an Ansible script by the DAU team. 
If you wish to install `ewoksscxrd` manually, ensure you have Python 3.8+ and `pip` installed. You can install the library directly from PyPI:
