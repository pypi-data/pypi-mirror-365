# thin client library for Katzenpost client daemon

*A thin client for sending and receiving messages via a Katzenpost mix network.*

A mix network is a type of anonymous communications network.

A thin client library is code you can use as a depencency in your
application so that it can anonymously interact with services on the
mix network. The Katzenpost client daemon is a multiplexing client;
many applications on the same device can use their thin client
libraries to connect to the daemon and interact with mixnet services
concurrently.
