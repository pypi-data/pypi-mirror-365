# pygofastproxy

A blazing-fast HTTP proxy for Python, powered by Go’s [fasthttp](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp) library.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Install the package:**
   ```bash
   pip install pygofastproxy
   ```
2. **Start your backend server** (e.g., Flask) on port 4000.
3. **Run the proxy:**
   ```python
   from pygofastproxy.runner import run_proxy
   run_proxy(target="http://localhost:4000", port=8080)
   ```
4. **Send requests** to `http://localhost:8080`.

## How it Works

pygofastproxy launches a Go-based HTTP proxy as a subprocess from Python. The Go proxy listens on the specified port and forwards all HTTP requests to your backend server. Configuration is handled via Python arguments or environment variables.

---

## Overview

pygofastproxy is a Python package that provides a super-fast HTTP proxy, powered by Go, for use with Python web backends. It is ideal for scenarios where you want to:
- Add a high-performance reverse proxy in front of your Python (Flask, FastAPI, Django, etc.) backend.
- Integrate with frontend frameworks (like Next.js) that need to proxy API requests to a Python backend.
- Use as a development tool to forward requests, add logging, or simulate production-like proxying locally.
- Robust and Secure. 

## Features
- Fast HTTP proxying using Go's fasthttp library
- Simple Python API to launch and control the proxy
- Automatic Go binary build if not present
- Easily configurable target and port
- **Planned:** Pre-built binaries for easier installation (coming soon!)
- **More features coming soon!**

## Installation

You can install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install pygofastproxy
```

Or, for local development:

```bash
pip install /path/to/pygofastproxy
```

## Usage

### As a Python Module

```python
from pygofastproxy.runner import run_proxy

# Start the proxy (forwards :8080 to your backend at :4000)
run_proxy(target="http://localhost:4000", port=8080)
```

- By default, the proxy will listen on `localhost:8080` and forward to your backend at `localhost:4000`.
- You can adjust the `target` and `port` as needed.

---

## Environment Variables

You can control the proxy using these environment variables:
- `PY_BACKEND_TARGET`: The backend server URL to forward requests to (default: `http://localhost:4000`).
- `PY_BACKEND_PORT`: The port for the proxy to listen on (default: `8080`).

---

## Testing

To manually test the proxy:
1. Start a backend server on port 4000 (e.g., `python3 -m http.server 4000`).
2. Start the proxy as shown above.
3. In another terminal, run:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080
   ```
   You should see the response from your backend, confirming the proxy is working.

## Example: Use with Flask and Next.js (Dockerized)

Suppose you have a Flask backend and a Next.js frontend. You can use pygofastproxy as a reverse proxy between them:

- Frontend (Next.js) sends API requests to `localhost:8080`
- pygofastproxy forwards requests to Flask backend at `localhost:4000`

**docker-compose.yml** (simplified):

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  proxy:
    build: ./proxy
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - backend

  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"

  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

## Use Cases

- **Development proxy**: Quickly forward requests from a frontend to a Python backend, simulating production proxying.
- **Performance**: Add a fast Go-based proxy in front of Python services for better throughput.
- **API Gateway**: Use as a lightweight API gateway for microservices.
- **Testing**: Intercept and forward requests for integration testing.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Go (for building the proxy binary)
