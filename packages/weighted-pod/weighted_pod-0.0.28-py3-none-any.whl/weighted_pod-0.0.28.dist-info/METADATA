# WeightedPOD

A Python library for Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with weighted inner products, specifically designed for CFD analysis with non-uniform meshes.

## Features

- Volume-weighted POD for non-uniform meshes
- Memory-efficient implementation using float32
- Both snapshot method and SVD approaches
- Comprehensive visualization tools
- Easy-to-use API

## Installation

```bash
pip install weighted-pod
