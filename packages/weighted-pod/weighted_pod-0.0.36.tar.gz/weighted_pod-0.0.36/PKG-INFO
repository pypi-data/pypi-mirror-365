Description: # WeightedPOD
        
        A Python library for Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with weighted inner products, specifically designed for CFD analysis with non-uniform meshes.
        
        ## Features
        
        - Volume-weighted POD for non-uniform meshes
        - Memory-efficient implementation using float32
        - Both snapshot method and SVD approaches
        - Comprehensive visualization tools
        - Easy-to-use API
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install weighted-pod
