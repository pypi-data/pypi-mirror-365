# ConText

![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/polsci/ConText) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.16360951.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.16360951)

A browser-based concordancer and text analysis application.  

ConText is a new tool allowing you to to analyze corpora through a browser-based interface. Rather than separating out reports views, ConText uses hyperlinks to allow you to navigate connections between keywords, collocates, clusters, and specific texts. ConText is relevant for corpus linguistic analysis, data scientists working with text, and academics who want a knew way to engage with their texts. 

ConText is in active development and is currently released as a Python package. ConText builds on [Conc](https://github.com/polsci/conc), a Python library for corpus analysis. ConText can be used as a graphical user interface to analyse corpora with Conc. More updates, including a video tutorial and installers for different operating systems, are coming soon. I welcome your feedback and I'm keen to help if you have problems. The easiest way to make contact about ConText is to [raise an issue](https://github.com/polsci/ConText/issues/new).

This repository builds on work done in 2020 on a Python library, Jupyter Notebook and Dash application for the Mapping LAWS project. This work prototyped a browser-based alternative to desktop applications for corpus analysis. Ideas for this tool originated during my PhD thesis, which developed a browser-based analysis tool around a corpus of parliamentary discourse enabling rapid queries, new forms of analysis and browseable connections between different levels of analysis. ConText, in the form released, has been rewritten from the ground up, using Flask, flaskwebgui, HTMX, Hyperscript and [Conc](https://geoffford.nz/conc/).

## Design principles

### Embed ConText

A key principle is to embed context from the texts, corpus and beyond into the application. This includes design choices to make the text, metadata and origin of the text visible and accessible. The text corpus can be navigated (and read) via a concordancer that sits alongside the text. To aide the researcher in interpretation, quantifications are directly linked to the texts they relate to. 

### Efficiency

The software prioritises speed through pre-processing via [Conc](https://github.com/polsci/conc). Intensive processing (tokenising, creating indexes, pre-computing useful counts) happens when the corpus is first built. This is done once and stored. This speeds up subsequent queries and statistical calculations. 

### A browseable corpus

The frontend uses web technologies to make different views of the corpus available in an interactive, playful way. The interface is minimal and lightweight. The interface uses hyperlinks to open up pathways for analysis allowing navigation between levels of analysis. You can quickly switch corpora and reference corpora facilitating straightforward comparative analysis.

## Installation

ConText is currently [released as a pip-installable package](https://pypi.org/project/contextapp/). Other installation methods are coming soon.  

To install via pip, [setup a new Python 3.11+ environment](https://github.com/polsci/ConText/blob/main/installation.md#python-setup) and run the following command:  

```bash
pip install contextapp
```

ConText/Conc requires installation of a Spacy model. For example, for English:  

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

Note: check out additional [installation notes](https://github.com/polsci/ConText/blob/main/installation.md) if you want information on setting up Python, setting up ConText for "app" mode, if you are using an older machine (pre-2013), or if you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

## Using ConText

To use ConText currently you need to [build your corpora using Conc from text files or CSV sources](https://geoffford.nz/conc/tutorials/recipes.html). You should have a corpus and reference corpus. Conc provides [sample corpora to download and build](https://geoffford.nz/conc/api/corpora.html#build-sample-corpora).  

To allow ConText to find them when it starts up store the created corpora in the same parent directory.  

Run ConText like this ...  

```bash
ConText --corpora /path/to/directory/with/processed/corpora/
```

ConText can be run in different modes:

* "production" mode is the default. This will launch a ConText server. You will see a message to launch a browser and access a specific URL.
* "app" mode - this launches a web browser in "app mode". You will need a browser installed and a default browser set for your operating system. 
* "development" mode - this launched ConText as a server with Flask's debug mode enabled. This is intended for development and debugging. 

To set the mode add the --mode argument to the command. For example, to set mode to "app", run ConText with:   

```bash
ConText --corpora /path/to/directory/with/processed/corpora/ --mode app
```

A video tutorial on how to use ConText is coming soon.
