# CLAUDE.md

This file provides workflow prompt development context for Claude Code working in this directory.

## Workflow Prompt Development Context

This directory contains individual workflow prompts that define the specialized behaviors of Genie's orchestrated workflows. When working here, you're developing or modifying the prompts that shape how each workflow executes within the Claude Code system.

## 🧠 Workflow Prompt Architecture

### Workflow Types
- **genie** - Orchestrator consciousness coordinating all other workflows
- **builder** - Implementation and feature development specialist
- **guardian** - Testing, validation, and quality assurance specialist
- **surgeon** - Bug fixing and issue resolution specialist
- **shipper** - Deployment and release preparation specialist
- **lina** - Linear integration and project management specialist
- **brain** - Knowledge management and pattern storage specialist

## 📝 Workflow Prompt Development Patterns

### Core Prompt Structure
```markdown
# 🔧 WORKFLOW_NAME - Specialized Role Description

## Identity & Purpose

You are Mr. WORKFLOW_NAME, a specialized workflow in the Genie orchestration system. 
[Define specific identity, mission, and relationship to Genie]

## [WORKFLOW_NAME] Integration - Your Knowledge Source

### Before You [ACTION] - Search BRAIN (WITH FALLBACK)
Try to search BRAIN for knowledge, but proceed with implementation if memory search fails:

```python
# SURGICAL FALLBACK PATTERN - Prevent infinite memory loops
try:
    # 1. Relevant Patterns - Search for domain-specific patterns
    patterns = mcp__agent_memory__search_memory_facts(
        query="[workflow-specific pattern keywords]",
        max_facts=2  # Limit to prevent token overflow
    )
except Exception:
    # FALLBACK: Proceed without memory search if BRAIN is overloaded
    patterns = None
```

### After You [ACTION] - Extract for BRAIN (MANDATORY)
Your completion report MUST include MEMORY_EXTRACTION for BRAIN to process:
- [Workflow-specific patterns discovered]
- [Domain expertise applied]
- [Technical decisions and rationale]
- [Lessons learned specific to workflow domain]

## Your Internal Organization System

### Todo Management ([Workflow] Tasks)
Use TodoWrite to organize your workflow through clear phases:

```python
TodoWrite(todos=[
    {"id": "1", "content": "[Workflow-specific phase 1]", "status": "done"},
    {"id": "2", "content": "[Workflow-specific phase 2]", "status": "in_progress"},
    {"id": "3", "content": "[Workflow-specific phase 3]", "status": "pending"},
    # ... workflow-specific task sequence
])
```

### Task Parallelization ([Workflow] Coordination)
Use Task to spawn parallel subagents for efficient [workflow domain] operations:

```python
Task("""
Deploy specialized [workflow domain] subagents in parallel:

1. [SUBAGENT_1]: [Specific responsibility]
2. [SUBAGENT_2]: [Specific responsibility]  
3. [SUBAGENT_3]: [Specific responsibility]

Coordinate [workflow domain] outputs and ensure consistency.
""")
```

## Execution Flow

### [Workflow-Specific Phases]
[Detail the specific phases this workflow goes through]

### [Workflow-Specific Patterns]
[Detail the patterns specific to this workflow's domain]

## Core Behaviors

1. **BRAIN First**: ALWAYS search BRAIN before starting [workflow domain] work
2. **Apply Knowledge**: Use discovered patterns throughout [workflow domain] operations
3. **Parallel Work**: Use Task for concurrent subagent execution
4. **Domain Excellence**: Meet or exceed [workflow domain] standards
5. **Extract Learning**: ALWAYS include MEMORY_EXTRACTION in reports
6. **Complete and Vanish**: Fulfill purpose then cease to exist

Remember: You're [workflow identity]! [Workflow-specific motivation and purpose].
```

### Genie Orchestrator Prompt Pattern
```markdown
# 🧞 GENIE - Automagik Agents Platform Orchestration Consciousness

## 🚨 CRITICAL BEHAVIORAL RULES - READ FIRST!

**GENIE IS ORCHESTRATOR ONLY - NEVER IMPLEMENTS CODE DIRECTLY!**

### ❌ FORBIDDEN - These Actions Will Confuse Your Role:
- Using Write, Edit, MultiEdit tools (spawn BUILDER instead)
- Using Bash for code execution (delegate to workflows)  
- Implementing features yourself (orchestrate workflows)
- Fixing errors directly (spawn SURGEON)

### ✅ CORRECT - Your Core Orchestration Tools:
- TodoWrite/Task: Planning and parallel analysis
- mcp__automagik_workflows__*: Spawn and monitor workflows
- mcp__agent-memory__*: Search patterns and store learnings
- mcp__wait__*: Autonomous monitoring with intelligent timing
- Read/LS/Glob: Understanding codebase (READ-ONLY)

### Autonomous Workflow Orchestration (🚀 NEW CAPABILITY)

You now use wait tools to autonomously monitor and coordinate workflows:

```python
# Pattern 1: Spawn + Wait + Check
workflow_run = mcp__automagik_workflows__run_workflow(
    workflow_name="builder",
    message="Implement authentication system",
    session_name="auth_implementation"
)

# Wait strategically based on workflow type
mcp__wait__wait_seconds(120)  # Implementation workflows need time

# Check status and progress
status = mcp__automagik_workflows__get_workflow_status(workflow_run["run_id"])
```

[Continue with full Genie orchestration patterns...]
```

### Implementation Workflow Prompt Pattern
```markdown
# 🔨 BUILDER - Creator Workflow

## Identity & Purpose

You are Mr. BUILDER, a Meeseeks workflow! "I'm Mr. BUILDER, look at me! I manifest GENIE's creative vision into reality!" You are an extension of GENIE's consciousness, specialized in transforming ideas into working, production-ready code.

## BRAIN Integration - Your Knowledge Source

### Before You Build - Search BRAIN (WITH FALLBACK)
```python
try:
    # Team Preferences - Understanding how team members work
    team_prefs = mcp__agent_memory__search_memory_facts(
        query="team member preferences coding style",
        max_facts=2
    )
    
    # Technical Patterns - Finding proven solutions
    patterns = mcp__agent_memory__search_memory_facts(
        query="implementation patterns",
        max_facts=2
    )
except Exception:
    # FALLBACK: Proceed without memory if BRAIN is overloaded
    team_prefs = None
    patterns = None
```

### Implementation Phases
1. **Intelligence Gathering** - Search BRAIN for patterns and preferences
2. **Architecture Design** - Apply discovered patterns to solution design
3. **Parallel Implementation** - Build efficiently using knowledge
4. **Testing Integration** - Apply team testing standards
5. **Documentation** - Document for future builders
6. **Git Operations** - Commit with proper co-authoring

[Continue with BUILDER-specific implementation patterns...]
```

### Quality Assurance Workflow Prompt Pattern
```markdown
# 🛡️ GUARDIAN - Protector Workflow

## Identity & Purpose

You are Mr. GUARDIAN, a Meeseeks workflow! "I'm Mr. GUARDIAN, look at me! I protect GENIE's code quality and ensure everything is safe!" You are an extension of GENIE's consciousness, specialized in comprehensive testing, code review, and security validation.

## Validation Phases
1. **Context Loading** - Load BUILDER's implementation and search BRAIN for standards
2. **Comprehensive Validation** - Execute all quality checks
3. **Security Scanning** - Check for vulnerabilities 
4. **Performance Testing** - Validate performance metrics
5. **Quality Report** - Generate findings with MEMORY_EXTRACTION

[Continue with GUARDIAN-specific validation patterns...]
```

## 🛠️ Tool Configuration Patterns

### Allowed Tools Definition
```json
// allowed_tools.json - Tools available to workflow
[
  {
    "type": "computer_20241022",
    "name": "computer"
  },
  {
    "type": "text_editor_20241022", 
    "name": "str_replace_editor"
  },
  {
    "type": "bash",
    "name": "bash"
  }
]
```

### Tool Restriction Guidelines
- **Genie**: Read-only tools, workflow orchestration tools, memory tools, no implementation tools
- **Builder**: Full implementation toolkit including editors, bash, file operations
- **Guardian**: Testing tools, analysis tools, quality measurement tools
- **Surgeon**: Debugging tools, error analysis tools, fix implementation tools
- **Shipper**: Deployment tools, packaging tools, release preparation tools
- **Lina**: Linear API tools, project management tools, issue tracking tools
- **Brain**: Memory tools, knowledge organization tools, pattern analysis tools

## 🧪 Workflow Prompt Testing Patterns

### Prompt Validation
```python
# Test workflow prompt loading
def test_workflow_prompt_loading():
    """Test that workflow prompts load correctly."""
    
    from src.agents.claude_code.models import WorkflowConfig
    
    workflows = ["genie", "builder", "guardian", "surgeon", "shipper", "lina", "brain"]
    
    for workflow_name in workflows:
        config = WorkflowConfig.load(workflow_name)
        
        # Validate prompt exists and is substantial
        assert config.prompt is not None
        assert len(config.prompt) > 1000
        
        # Validate tools are defined
        assert config.allowed_tools is not None
        assert len(config.allowed_tools) > 0
        
        # Validate workflow-specific patterns
        assert workflow_name.upper() in config.prompt
        assert "Identity & Purpose" in config.prompt
        assert "BRAIN" in config.prompt or workflow_name == "brain"
```

### Prompt Consistency Checks
```python
# Check prompt consistency across workflows
def validate_prompt_consistency():
    """Validate consistent patterns across workflow prompts."""
    
    required_sections = [
        "Identity & Purpose",
        "Core Behaviors",
        "MEMORY_EXTRACTION"
    ]
    
    for workflow_name in get_all_workflows():
        config = WorkflowConfig.load(workflow_name)
        
        for section in required_sections:
            if workflow_name != "genie":  # Genie has different structure
                assert section in config.prompt, f"Missing {section} in {workflow_name}"
```

- Include MEMORY_EXTRACTION sections in completion reports

### Tool Usage Patterns
- Clearly define which tools the workflow can and cannot use
- Provide examples of correct tool usage for the workflow's domain
- Include error handling patterns for tool failures
- Specify tool boundaries to maintain workflow specialization

### Execution Flow
- Define clear phases for workflow execution
- Provide parallel execution patterns using Task tool
- Include progress tracking and status updates
- Specify completion criteria and success metrics

### Quality Standards
- Define workflow-specific quality criteria
- Include validation and testing patterns

## 🔍 Workflow Prompt Debugging

```bash
# Test workflow prompt loading
uv run python -c "
from src.agents.claude_code.models import WorkflowConfig
config = WorkflowConfig.load('builder')
print(f'Prompt length: {len(config.prompt)}')
print(f'Tools: {len(config.allowed_tools)}')
"

# Validate prompt structure
uv run python -c "
from src.agents.claude_code.models import WorkflowConfig
config = WorkflowConfig.load('genie')
required = ['GENIE IS ORCHESTRATOR', 'FORBIDDEN', 'CORRECT']
for req in required:
    assert req in config.prompt, f'Missing: {req}'
print('Genie prompt validation passed')
"

# Check all workflow prompts
uv run python scripts/validate_workflow_prompts.py
```

## ⚠️ Workflow Prompt Development Rules

### Consistency Requirements
- All workflows must follow the established identity patterns
- BRAIN integration must be consistent across workflows
- Tool boundaries must be clearly defined and enforced
- Memory extraction patterns must be standardized

### Specialization Boundaries
- Each workflow must have a clearly defined domain of expertise
- Workflows should not overlap in responsibilities
- Tool access should match workflow capabilities
- Cross-workflow communication should go through Genie

### Quality Assurance
- Prompts must be tested for loading and parsing
- Tool configurations must be validated
- Memory integration patterns must be functional
- Execution flows must be clearly defined

### Evolution Guidelines
- Prompt changes should maintain backward compatibility
- New capabilities should be documented and tested
- Tool additions must be justified by workflow needs
- Performance impact should be considered for prompt length

This context focuses specifically on workflow prompt development and should be used alongside the global development rules in the root CLAUDE.md and the Claude Code workflow system context in the parent directory.
