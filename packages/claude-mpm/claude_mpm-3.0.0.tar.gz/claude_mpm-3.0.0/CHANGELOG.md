## [2.0.0] - 2025-07-27

### BREAKING CHANGES
- **Agent Schema Standardization**: Complete overhaul of agent definition format
  - Agent IDs no longer use `_agent` suffix (e.g., `research_agent` → `research`)
  - Migrated from YAML to JSON format with strict schema validation
  - All agents must conform to new standardized schema at `src/claude_mpm/schemas/agent_schema.json`
  - Resource allocation now uses predefined tiers (intensive, standard, lightweight)
  - Model names standardized (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` → `claude-4-sonnet-20250514`)

### Added
- **Comprehensive Schema Validation Framework**
  - JSON Schema-based validation for all agent definitions
  - Business rule validation for resource allocation consistency
  - Automatic validation on agent load
  - Migration tools for converting old format to new
- **Resource Tier System**
  - Three predefined tiers: intensive (900s/3072MB), standard (600s/2048MB), lightweight (300s/1024MB)
  - Automatic resource allocation based on agent type
  - Clear rationale for resource assignments
- **Enhanced Agent Metadata**
  - Required metadata fields: name, description, category, tags
  - Optional fields: author, created_at, updated_at
  - Improved agent discoverability through standardized tags
- **Validation API**
  - `AgentValidator` class for programmatic validation
  - Detailed error and warning reporting
  - Integration with CI/CD pipelines

### Changed
- **Agent Definition Format**
  - Migrated from YAML to JSON for better schema validation
  - Standardized field names and structure
  - Added required version field using semantic versioning
  - Instructions limited to 8000 characters for consistency
- **Agent Loader Improvements**
  - Backward compatibility for old agent IDs (both `research` and `research_agent` work)
  - Performance improvements through caching (1.6x faster)
  - Better error messages for validation failures
- **Model Naming Convention**
  - Standardized to `claude-{version}-{variant}-{date}` format
  - Updated all agents to use consistent model names

### Fixed
- **Validation Issues**
  - Inconsistent versioning across agents (was using integers, now semantic)
  - Resource allocation inconsistencies
  - Missing required fields in some agents
  - Tool array inconsistencies

### Migration Guide
- See [Schema Standardization Migration Guide](docs/user/05-migration/schema-standardization-migration.md)
- Use backward compatibility layer during transition
- Run validation on all custom agents before deployment
