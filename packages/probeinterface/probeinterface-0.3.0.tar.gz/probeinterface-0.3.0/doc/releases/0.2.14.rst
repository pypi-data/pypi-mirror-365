probeinterface 0.2.14
---------------------


October, 27th 2022

* Fix a **important bug** in :code:`read_spikeglx()` / :code:`read_imro()` that was leading
  to wrong contact locations when the Imec Readout Table (aka imRo)
  was set with complex multi-bank patterns.
  The bug was introduced with version **0.2.10**, released on September 1st 2022, and it is also present in these
  versions: **0.2.10**, **0.2.11**, **0.2.12**, and **0.2.13**.

  **If you used spikeinterface/probeinterface with SpikeGLX data using one of these versions, we recommend you
  to check your contact positions (if they are non-standard - using the probe tip) and re-run your spike-sorting
  analysis if they are wrong.**

  A big thanks to Tom Bugnon and Graham Findlay for
  `spotting the bug <https://github.com/SpikeInterface/probeinterface/issues/141>`_.
