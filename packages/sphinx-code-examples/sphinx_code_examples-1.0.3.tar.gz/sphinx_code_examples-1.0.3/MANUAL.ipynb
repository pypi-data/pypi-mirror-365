    "\n",
    "This extension provides three directives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `codex`\n",

    "- `codex-end`\n",

    "### `codex` directive\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "Although this directive is called `codex`, it does not imply that the code is executable. It is simply a directive to create the possibility to use one extension for both executable and non-executable (code) examples.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `codex` directive is used to create an example. It can be used as with the following minimal syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "````md\n",

    ":label: example-codex\n",
    "\n",
