# 🧰 Machine Learning Toolbox

This repository provides a collection of modular, production-ready tools for building, evaluating, and interpreting machine learning models. Each tool is built with a focus on clean design, extensibility, and practical utility.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy: Explainable, Transparent, Glass-Box ML

Unlike traditional AutoML tools that act as "black boxes", this toolbox is designed to be a **glass box** — every decision, transformation, and output is **fully transparent and controllable**.

This toolbox is ideal for:
- Data scientists who value **interpretable models**
- **Regulated industries** requiring auditability
- Educators and learners exploring machine learning foundations
- Teams that prioritize **trust and understanding** over automation

We emphasize **explainability** through SHAP, feature importances, coefficients, and detailed diagnostics at every stage.

## 🔍 Module Overviews

### `DataExplorer.py`
A lightweight class for quick exploratory analysis:
- Displays dataset shape, dtypes, and missing values
- Plots target distribution (auto-detects regression vs classification)
- Correlation heatmap and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
- Returns median-imputed numeric-only DataFrame for diagnostics

### `ML_pipeline.py`
A complete scikit-learn-based pipeline manager:
- Auto-detects numerical and categorical columns
- Builds preprocessing pipeline (scaling, imputation, encoding)
- Supports both regression and classification
- Cross-validation with metrics, ROC, F1-thresholds, and confusion matrix
- Built-in visualizations for:
  - Predicted vs. Actual
  - Residual plots
  - Error distribution
  - ROC curve and F1-threshold optimization

### `ModelInterpreter.py`
Interpret model behavior post-training:
- Works with pipelines and standalone models
- Tree-based models: Feature importances
- Linear models: Coefficients (with optional plot)
- Universal SHAP summary plot (auto-handles pipelines)

### `RecommendationEngine.py`
Simple framework for personalized customer targeting:
- Identify top-N high-value customers by prediction scores
- Recommend segments based on quantiles (e.g., LTV)
  - High-value → Retention
  - Low-value → Acquisition

### `Clustering.py`
KMeans-based customer segmentation:
- Automatically scales numeric features
- Assigns cluster labels
- Visualizes clusters with seaborn scatter plots

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each module can be used independently. Example usage:

```python
from ML_pipeline import MLPipeline
pipeline = MLPipeline()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = pipeline.split_data(df, 'target')
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
pipeline.plot_roc_curve(X_test, y_test)
```

Or for model interpretation:

```python
from ModelInterpreter import ModelInterpreter
interpreter = ModelInterpreter(model, X_train, task='classification')
interpreter.shap_summary()
```

---

## 📎 Requirements

- `scikit-learn`
- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `shap`
- `statsmodels` (for VIF)

---

## 📌 Notes

- SHAP is optimized for tree-based models; linear models are also supported
- Pipelines handle preprocessing internally—no need to do it manually
- Modules follow sklearn conventions for compatibility and ease of use
