              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# nnInteractive: Redefining 3D Promptable Segmentation

This repository contains the napari plugin for nnInteractive. Check out the
[python backend](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnInteractive) and [MITK integration](https://www.mitk.org/MITK-nnInteractive) for more.

## What is nnInteractive?

##### Abstract:

Accurate and efficient 3D segmentation is essential for both clinical and research applications.
While foundation models like SAM have revolutionized interactive segmentation, their 2D design and domain shift limitations make them ill-suited for 3D medical images.
Current adaptations address some of these challenges but remain limited, either lacking volumetric awareness, offering restricted interactivity, or supporting only a small set of structures and modalities.
Usability also remains a challenge, as current tools are rarely integrated into established imaging platforms and often rely on cumbersome web-based interfaces with restricted functionality.
We introduce nnInteractive, the first comprehensive 3D interactive open-set segmentation method.
It supports diverse prompts‚Äîincluding points, scribbles, boxes, and a novel lasso prompt‚Äîwhile leveraging intuitive 2D interactions to generate full 3D segmentations.
Trained on 120+ diverse volumetric 3D datasets (CT, MRI, PET, 3D Microscopy, etc.), nnInteractive sets a new state-of-the-art in accuracy, adaptability, and usability.
Crucially, it is the first method integrated into widely used image viewers (e.g., Napari, MITK), ensuring broad accessibility for real-world clinical and research applications.
Extensive benchmarking demonstrates that nnInteractive far surpasses existing methods, setting a new standard for AI-driven interactive 3D segmentation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You need a Linux or Windows computer with a Nvidia GPU. 10GB of VRAM is recommended. Small objects should work with \<6GB.

##### 1. Create a virtual environment:

nnInteractive supports Python 3.10+ and works with Conda, pip, or any other virtual environment. Here‚Äôs an example using Conda:

```
conda create -n nnInteractive python=3.12
conda activate nnInteractive
```

##### 2. Install the correct PyTorch for your system

Go to the [PyTorch homepage](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and pick the right configuration.
Note that since recently PyTorch needs to be installed via pip. This is fine to do within your conda environment.

For Ubuntu with a Nvidia GPU, pick 'stable', 'Linux', 'Pip', 'Python', 'CUDA12.6' (if all drivers are up to date, otherwise use and older version):

```
pip3 install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
```

##### 3. Install this repository + dependencies via

Install napari if necessary

```bash
pip install napari[all]
```

Install the plugin via pip:

```bash
pip install napari-nninteractive
```

Or clone and install this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/napari-nninteractive
cd napari-nninteractive
pip install -e .
```

**Note:** Model weights are automatically downloaded on first use. This can take up to a couple of minutes depending on your internet connection

## Getting Started

Use one of these three options to start napari and activate the plugin.
Afterward, Drag and drop your images into napari.

\***Note if getting asked which plugin to use for opening .nii.gz files use napari-nifti.**

a) Start napari, then Plugins -> nnInteractive.

```
napari
```

b) Run this to start napari with the plugin already started.

```
napari -w napari-nninteractive
```

c) Run this to start napari with the plugin and open an image directly

```
napari demo_data/liver_145_0000.nii.gz -w napari-nninteractive
```

# How to use

**Note:** To open Nifti (.nii.gz, .nii) files we recommend to select napari-nifti.
