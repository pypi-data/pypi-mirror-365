    "description": "A fundamental challenge of microbial environmental science is to understand how earth systems will respond to climate change. A parallel challenge in biology is to unverstand how information encoded in organismal genes manifests as biogeochemical processes at ecosystem-to-global scales. These grand challenges intersect in the need to understand the glocal carbon (C) cycle, which is both mediated by biological processes and a key driver of climate through the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). A key aspect of these challenges is the C cycle implications of the predicted dramatic shrinkage in northern permafrost in the coming century.  ",
