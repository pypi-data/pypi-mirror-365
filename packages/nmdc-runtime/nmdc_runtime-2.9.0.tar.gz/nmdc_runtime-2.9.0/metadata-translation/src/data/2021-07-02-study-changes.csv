-'additional_info' added for sample 'LMS_cellobiose_enrichment' to indicate moose gut
-Removed environmental details, lat long, geo_lgraphic_location, and collection date for 3 viral samples, 2 microbial community samples, and 1 moose sample.
-Added 'community' details for 3 viral samples, 2 microbial community sampels, and 1 moose gut sample
-Added ""samp_mat_process"" to 3 viral samples and 2 microbial communities.
Need to make sure kitware can expose samp_mat_process in the Sample attributes","Need more details on the viral samples & microbial communities.

Stegen,Study,Gs0114663,Replace,study/description,"This research project, led by James Stegen at PNNL, aimed to understand how molecular-scale processes govern the biogeochemical function of subsurface groundwater-surface water mixing zones (i.e., the hyporheic zone). This project was conducted along the Columbia River in Eastern Washington State, which exhibits variation in microbiome composition, biogeochemical activity, and substrate biogeochemistry, making it an ideal environment for studying biogeochemical hotspots. To capture a range of biogeochemical activities, samples were collected from areas with dense vegetation and virtually no vegetation. 

This project’s long-term goal is to develop models that can simulate impacts of disturbance on river corridor hydro-biogeochemistry by understanding fundamental molecular processes that lead to emergent function. This project is part of PNNL’s River Corridor Hydrobiogeochemistry Science Focus Area (https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/river-corridor-hydrobiogeochemistry-science-focus-area).",,"Pajau wrote up short science stories a few months ago, and this description was shared with the FICUS PI.",

Brodie,Study,Gs0135149,Replace,study/description,"This research project aimed to understand how snow accumulation and snowmelt influences the mobilization of nitrogen through the soil microbiome in a mountainous catchment at the East River Watershed in Colorado. This project sought to identify bacteria, archaea, and fungi that were associated with the microbial biomass bloom that occurs during winter and the biomass crash following snowmelt. This project also sought to understand whether the traits that govern microbial community assembly during and after snowmelt were phylogenetically conserved. Samples were collected during winter, the snowmelt period, and after snowmelt in spring, from an area that transitioned from an upland hillslope to a riparian floodplain.

This project is part of the Watershed Function Science Focus Area: https://watershed.lbl.gov/.",,"Pajau wrote up short science stories a few months ago, and this description was shared with the FICUS PI.",

Also, this needs to be the URL to the files Kjiersten added to the NERSC file sytem under the HTTP server mounted www directory.

Also noticing that all ORCiD IDs must be set for PIs, that is also an attribute on the person_value object so a study ends up looking like:
