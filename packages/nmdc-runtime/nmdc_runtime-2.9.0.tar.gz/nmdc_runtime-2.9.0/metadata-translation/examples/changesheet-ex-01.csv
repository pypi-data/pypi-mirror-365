,,,,,description,"This research project, led by James Stegen at PNNL, aimed to understand how molecular-scale processes govern the biogeochemical function of subsurface groundwater-surface water mixing zones (i.e., the hyporheic zone). This project was conducted along the Columbia River in Eastern Washington State, which exhibits variation in microbiome composition, biogeochemical activity, and substrate biogeochemistry, making it an ideal environment for studying biogeochemical hotspots. To capture a range of biogeochemical activities, samples were collected from areas with dense vegetation and virtually no vegetation. This project’s long-term goal is to develop models that can simulate impacts of disturbance on river corridor hydro-biogeochemistry by understanding fundamental molecular processes that lead to emergent function. This project is part of PNNL’s River Corridor Hydrobiogeochemistry Science Focus Area (https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/river-corridor-hydrobiogeochemistry-science-focus-area)."
,,,,gold:Gs0114675,description,"This project aims to improve the understanding of microbial diversity and metabolism in deep shale, with implications for novel enzyme discovery and energy development. This project was conducted along two Appalachian basin shales, the Marcellus and Utica/Point Pleasant formations in Pennsylvania and Ohio, respectively. Samples were collected from input and produced fluids up to a year after hydraulic fracturing at varying depths and locations (4 wells, 2 basin shales)."

,,,,,description,"This research project aimed to understand how snow accumulation and snowmelt influences the mobilization of nitrogen through the soil microbiome in a mountainous catchment at the East River Watershed in Colorado. This project sought to identify bacteria, archaea, and fungi that were associated with the microbial biomass bloom that occurs during winter and the biomass crash following snowmelt. This project also sought to understand whether the traits that govern microbial community assembly during and after snowmelt were phylogenetically conserved. Samples were collected during winter, the snowmelt period, and after snowmelt in spring, from an area that transitioned from an upland hillslope to a riparian floodplain. This project is part of the Watershed Function Science Focus Area: https://watershed.lbl.gov/."
,,,,gold:Gs0154044,description,The goal of this Bio-Scales Pilot Project study is to understand how plant traits modify the microbiome and in particular how the coupled plant-soil-microbial system influences nitrogen transformation patterns and fluxes.
