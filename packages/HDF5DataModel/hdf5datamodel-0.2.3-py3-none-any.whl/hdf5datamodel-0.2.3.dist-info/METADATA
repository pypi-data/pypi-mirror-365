# Presentation

This project creates a data model based on HDF5 architecture and simplify writing and reading data from a standardized 
HDF5 file format. The data model has the following structure:

```plaintext
/ (File group)
    /Dataset (group)
        /Acquisition (group)
            /Acquisition Signal (group)
                /Traces (dataset)
            /Generation Signal (group)
                /Signal (dataset)
``` 

Each level has its own default attributes extendable by the user.

Each File can contain multiple Datasets.
A Dataset is a collection of Acquisitions of the same nature. For example, a measurement campaign of various samples.
An Acquisition is a set of one Generation Signal and multiple Acquisition Signals. Each time the acquisition or
generation parameters are modified a new Acquisition is created.
An Acquisition Signal (2D) is a set of Traces (1D) that are acquired at the same time.
A Generation Signal (1D) contains only one generation signal.

Note : to build the wheel file from this repo, use  
`pip -wheel . --no-deps -w dist`
