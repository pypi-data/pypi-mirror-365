geff is a specification for a file format for **exchanging** spatial graph data. It is not intended to be mutable, editable, chunked, or optimized for use in an application setting.

geff is the specification of the file format, but the library also includes implementations for writing from and reading to a networkx graph, a common Python in-memory graph data structure. The library uses semantic versioning, where changes to the specification bump the major or minor versions, and bugfixes for the example implementation bumps the patch version.
