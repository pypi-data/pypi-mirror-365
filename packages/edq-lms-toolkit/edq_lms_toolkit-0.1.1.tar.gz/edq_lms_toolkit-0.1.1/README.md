## Installation

The project (tools and API) can be installed from PyPi with:
```
pip install edq-lms-toolkit
```

Standard Python requirements are listed in `pyproject.toml`.
The project and Python dependencies can be installed from source with:
```
pip3 install .
```

### CLI Configuration

Before discussing specific tools, you should know some general information about
configuring and sending options to each CLI tool.

To know who you are and what you are working on the package needs a few configuration options:
 - `server` -- The LMS server to connect to.
 - `course` -- The LMS ID for the course you are working with.
 - `token` -- Your LMS API token (for Canvas, see the [Canvas documentation](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Admin-Guide/How-do-I-manage-API-access-tokens-as-an-admin/ta-p/89).
 - `assignment` -- A query for the current assignment you are working on (does not always apply).

All these options can be set on the command line when invoking on of these tools, e.g.,:
```sh
python3 -m lms.cli.user.list --server lms.test.com --course 12345 --token abc123
```
However, it will generally be more convenient to hold these common options in a more reusable location.

There are several other places that config options can be specified,
with each later location overriding any earlier options.
Here are the places options can be specified in the order that they are checked:
 1. `./edq-lms.json` -- If a `edq-lms.json` exists in the current directory, it is loaded.
 2. `<platform-specific user config location>/edq-lms.json` -- A directory which is considered the "proper" place to store user-related config for the platform you are using (according to [platformdirs](https://github.com/platformdirs/platformdirs)). Use `--help` to see the exact place in your specific case. This is a great place to store login credentials.
 3. Files specified by `--config` -- These files are loaded in the order they appear on the command-line.
 4. Bare Options -- Options specified directly like `--course` or `--token`. These will override all previous options.

Using the default config file (`edq-lms.json`):
```sh
# `./edq-lms.json` will be looked for and loaded if it exists.
python3 -m lms.cli.user.list
```

Using a custom config file (`my_config.json`):
```sh
# `./my_config.json` will be used.
python3 -m lms.cli.user.list --config my_config.json
```

A sample config file is provided in this repo at [sample-edq-lms.json](./sample-edq-lms.json).

For brevity, all future commands in this document will assume that all standard config options are in the default
config files (and thus will not need to be specified).

## Usage Notes

### Name Resolution and Labels

The LMS Toolkit is able to resolve most objects that have a name,
so you can refer to that object by name instead of by ID.
Fields with this resolution will be referred to as "queries".
The exact attributes that can be used as a query depend on the underlying object,
for example users can use their name or email in a user query.

A "label" is a formatted field that the LMS Toolkit will use in certain cases that includes both the name and id in a single field:
"name (id)".

### Tables

Most commands that list results can also output results into a tab-separated table (on stdout)
using the `-t` / `--table` option.
To skip the header row, you can use the `--skip-headers` option.

### JSON Output

Most commands that list results can output them as JSON to stdout using the `--json` option.

## CLI Tools

All CLI tools can be invoked with `-h` / `--help` to see the full usage and all options.

### User Tools

When a user is required, tools and API functions accept a "user query" (unless specified).
A user query is any object that can be used to uniquely identify a user.
Valid user queries are:
 - LMS User ID (as an integer or string of digits)
 - Email
 - Full Name
 - "email (id)" where "email" is an email and "id" is a LMS ID

User queries must be unambiguous within the pool of possible users (e.g., students in a course).
It is recommended to use an email or LMS ID as a user query.
Resolving a user query that is not a LMS ID will take longer,
because a list of users must be fetched from the LMS.

#### List Course Users

Course users can be listed using the `lms.cli.user.list` tool.
For example:
```
python3 -m lms.cli.user.list
```

#### Fetch a Single User

To fetch information about a single course user, use the `lms.cli.user.fetch` tool.
For example:
```
python3 -m lms.cli.user.fetch 12345

# Or
python3 -m lms.cli.user.fetch alice@uni.edu
```

### Assignment Tools

When an assignment is required, tools and API functions accept an "assignment query" (unless specified).
An assignment query is any object that can be used to uniquely identify an assignment.
Valid assignment queries are:
 - LMS Assignment ID (as an integer or string of digits)
 - Full Name
 - "name (id)" where "name" is a full assignment name and "id" is a LMS ID

Assignment queries must be unambiguous within the pool of possible assignments (e.g., assignments in a course).
Resolving an assignment query that is not a LMS ID will take longer,
because a list of assignments must be fetched from the LMS.

#### List Assignments

Course assignments can be listed using the `lms.cli.assignment.list` tool.
For example:
```
python3 -m lms.cli.assignment.list
```

#### Fetch a Single Assignment

Fetch information about a single assignment using the `lms.cli.assignment.fetch` tool.
For example:
```
python3 -m lms.cli.assignment.fetch 123456

# Or
python3 -m lms.cli.assignment.fetch 'My Assignment'
```

#### Fetch Assignment Scores

To fetch the scores for a specific assignment, use the `lms.cli.assignment.fetch-scores` tool.
For example:
```
python3 -m lms.cli.assignment.fetch-scores 123456

# Or
python3 -m lms.cli.assignment.fetch-scores 'My Assignment'
```

The student's email and score will be written to stdout as a tab-separated row.

#### Fetch Assignment Submission Files

To fetch the files students have submitted for an assignment, use the `lms.cli.assignment.fetch-submission-files` tool.
For example:
```
python3 -m lms.cli.assignment.fetch-submission-files 123456

# Or
python3 -m lms.cli.assignment.fetch-submission-files 'My Assignment'
```

Only assignment with a submission type of "Online - Text Entry" or "Online - File Uploads" will be downloaded.

By default, files will be written to the `out` directory.
This can be controlled with the `--out-dir` argument.

#### Upload Assignment Scores

Uploading scores for an assignment can be done with the `lms.cli.assignment.upload-scores` tool:
```
python3 -m lms.cli.assignment.upload-scores <assignment query> <path>
```

Where `<path>` points to a tab-separated file where each row has 2-3 columns: email, score, and comment (optional).
Each row does not need to have the same length (i.e., some rows can have comments where others do not).
Empty comments are ignored.

The `--skip-rows` argument can be used to skip a specified number of header rows.
For example:
```
python3 -m lms.cli.assignment.upload-scores 'My Assignment' grades.txt --skip-rows 1
```

Where `grades.txt` looks like:
```
user	score	comment?
1001	75
alice@uni.edu	100	Great Job!
```

#### Upload Single Assignment Score

To upload just one assignment score without a file, you can use the `lms.cli.assignment.upload-score` tool:
```
python3 -m lms.cli.assignment.upload-score <assignment query> <user query> <score> [comment]
```

Note that the comment is optional.

For example:
```
python3 -m lms.cli.assignment.upload-score 'My Assignment' alice@uni.edu 100 'Great Job!'
```

### Gradebook Tools

#### Fetch Gradebook

To fetch the full gradebook for a course, use the `lms.cli.gradebook.fetch` tool.
For example:
```
python3 -m lms.cli.gradebook.fetch
```

A gradebook will be written to stdout as a tab-separated file.
To output the gradebook to a file, you can redirect stdout to a file.
Expect this command to take a few minutes for larger classes.

You can limit to gradebook to only specific students by specifying their IDs on the command line.
Any number of students can be specified.
```
python3 -m lms.cli.gradebook.fetch 12345 67890
```

By default, assignments and users without submissions will be pruned.
They can be included by using the respective `--include-empty-assignments` and `--include-empty-users` flags.

For example, you can write a gradebook with all assignments and users to `grades.txt` using the following command:
```
python3 -m lms.cli.gradebook.fetch --include-empty-assignments --include-empty-users > grades.txt
```

To include scores that are computed by the LMS (such as the final score), use the `--include-computed-scores` flag:
```
python3 -m lms.cli.gradebook.fetch --include-computed-scores
```

#### Upload Gradebook

To upload a gradebook, use the `lms.cli.gradebook.upload` tool:
```
python3 -m lms.cli.gradebook.upload <path>
```

Where `<path>` points to a gradebook file that has the same format as the output from `lms.cli.gradebook.fetch`:
a tab-separated file with users down the rows and assignments along the columns.
The first column is user queries where the first cell is ignored,
the first row is assignment queries where the first cell is ignored,
and the remaining cells are the associated scores.
Any number of users and assignments can be specified as long as they exist in the course.
Empty cells will not be uploaded.

A gradebook file can look like:
```
user	98765	Assignment 2
1001	1	2
alice@uni.edu	3	
```

### Assignment Group Tools

A "grouping", also called a "group set" or "group category" in LMS,
is a set of groups created for a specific purpose (like for a specific assignment).
A grouping has a name and contains groups.
A "group" is a collection of users (usually students).
The hierarchy goes "grouping" -> "group" -> "user".

When a group is required, tools and API functions accept a "group query" (unless specified).
(All information about group queries also applies to grouping queries.)
A group query is any object that can be used to uniquely identify a group.
Valid group queries are:
 - LMS Group ID (as an integer or string of digits)
 - Full Name
 - "name (id)" where "name" is a full group name and "id" is a LMS ID

Group queries must be unambiguous within the pool of possible groups (e.g., groups in a course).

#### List Groupings

Groups in a course can be listed using the `lms.cli.group.list-groupings` tool.
For example:
```
python3 -m lms.cli.group.list-groupings
```

Note that this lists the groupings themselves,
not groups in the groupings or the users in those groups.

#### List Groups

To list the groups (not groupings) in a course, use the `lms.cli.group.list-groups` tool.
For example:
```
python3 -m lms.cli.group.list-groups
```

To limit the results based on grouping, provide a query for that grouping.
For example:
```
python3 -m lms.cli.group.list-groups 12345

# Or
python3 -m lms.cli.group.list-groups 'My Grouping'
```

#### List Membership in a Grouping

To list the users inside each group within a grouping, use the `lms.cli.group.list-grouping-membership` tool.
For example:
```
python3 -m lms.cli.group.list-grouping-membership 12345

# Or
python3 -m lms.cli.group.list-grouping-membership 'My Grouping'
```

#### List Members in a Group

To list the users inside a specific group (not a grouping), use the `lms.cli.group.list-group-members` tool.
For example:
```
python3 -m lms.cli.group.list-group-members 12345

# Or
python3 -m lms.cli.group.list-group-members 'My Group'
```

### Quiz Tools

#### List Quizzes

Course quizzes can be listed using the `lms.cli.quiz.list` tool:
```
python3 -m lms.cli.quiz.list
```

#### Fetch a Single Quiz

Fetch information about a single quiz using the `lms.cli.quiz.fetch` tool.
For example:
```
python3 -m lms.cli.quiz.fetch 123456

# Or using the quiz's name.
python3 -m lms.cli.quiz.fetch 'My Quiz'
```
