# Impossibly

Impossibly is a lean Python library for building and orchestrating production AI agents. Declare tools as plain Python functions, keep a tiny dependency footprint, and skip the boilerplate‚Äîthe stable core ships with first-class multimodal support and built-in tracing so you can ship and debug impossibly fast.

üéØ Why Impossibly?
---
1. Stable core without surprise breakages.
2. Ultra-lean footprint. No dependency bloat.
3. Declare tools as plain Python functions.
4. Multi-modal out of the box.
5. Powerful agents without the boilerplate. It's time to build impossibly fast.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```python
from impossibly import Agent, Graph, START, END

# Create an Impossibly agent
agent = Agent(
    client=openai_client,
    model="gpt-4o",
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant",
    tools=[web_search, calculator, database]
)

# Build a reasoning workflow
graph = Graph()
graph.add_edge(START, agent)
graph.add_edge(agent, END)

# Execute with autonomous reasoning
result = graph.invoke("Analyze current market trends and provide strategic recommendations")
```

## ‚ú® Core Features

### One-line Agent Instantiation
Define agents and the tools available to them in a single object instantiation:
- **Native Multi-modal Support**: Agents can work with both text and images straight out of the box
- **Native Routing**: Under-the-hood prompt-injection to ensure intelligent decision making and routing
- **Custom Functions:**
Build functions simply with Python, then connect them as tools to your agents

### Graph-Based Orchestration
Agents connected with a visual and intuitive workflow design:
- **Conditional Logic**: Route based on agent decisions
- **Monitoring**: Track agent performance and decisions

### Tool Integration
Seamless connection to external systems and data with native Python functions:
- **User-Created Tools**: Connect to any API, service, database and more with self-defined Python functions
- **Own Your Tools**: Core updates won't break your functions‚Äîfull control and easy fixes
- **Custom Tools**: Build domain-specific capabilities with Python

### Designed for Multi-Agent Architectures
Specialized agents working together on complex tasks:
- **Role-Based Design**: Each agent has a specific expertise
- **Coordinated Workflows**: Agents pass work between each other
- **Quality Assurance**: Multiple agents validate and improve results
- **Scalable Architecture**: Add agents as complexity grows

## üìö Examples

Explore practical implementations in the `/examples` directory:

- **SQL Agent**: Autonomous database analysis with iterative reasoning
- **Research Agent**: Multi-step research with source validation
- **Conversational Agents**: Context-aware dialogue systems
- **Tool Agents**: Specialized agents for specific tasks
- **Mixture of Experts**: Dynamic agent selection based on task requirements
