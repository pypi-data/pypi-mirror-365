Graphical User Interface
========================

The Waveform Editor provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI), with which you can:

* Load an existing YAML file from disk
* Create/remove groups
* Create/remove waveforms
* View or edit waveforms
* Store changes back to YAML

The GUI can be launched using:

.. code-block:: bash

   waveform-editor gui

TODO: The usage of the GUI will be written in detail once the GUI is in a further state of development.
