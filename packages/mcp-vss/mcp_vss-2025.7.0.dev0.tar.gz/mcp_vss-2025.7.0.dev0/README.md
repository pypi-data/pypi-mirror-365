# ITS Private Cloud MCP Server (Beta)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides seamless integration with the 
University of Toronto's ITS Private Cloud Virtual Server Service (VSS). This server
enables AI assistants to manage virtual machines, analyze billing data, 
monitor performance, and optimize cloud resources through natural language interactions.

## What is Model Context Protocol?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants 
to securely connect to external data sources and tools. 
Think of it as a universal translator that allows AI models to:

- **Access Real-time Data**: Connect to live systems and databases
- **Execute Actions**: Perform operations like creating snapshots or managing VMs
- **Maintain Context**: Keep track of resources and relationships across conversations
- **Ensure Security**: Authenticate and authorize access to sensitive systems

With MCP, your AI assistant becomes a powerful interface to your cloud infrastructure, 
capable of understanding complex queries like "Show me the most expensive VMs this month 
and suggest cost optimizations" or "Create a snapshot of the database server before the 
maintenance window.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- ITS Private Cloud VSS API access token
- MCP-compatible AI client (Claude Desktop, etc.)

### Installation

#### Using `uvx`
1. Install `uv` from [Astral](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) or the [GitHub README](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation)
2. Install Python using `uv python install 3.10`
```bash
uvx mcp-vss
```

### Configuration

Add the server to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vss": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-vss"],
      "env": {

    }
  }
}
```
