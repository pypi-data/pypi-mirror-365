**Cognize** is a symbolic cognition layer for Python systems — from LLMs to agents to simulations.  
It enables programmable epistemic control by modeling belief (`V`), reality (`R`), misalignment (`∆`), memory (`E`), and rupture (`Θ`).

---

## Features

- Drift-aware cognition engine (`EpistemicState`)
- Programmable rupture thresholds and realignment logic
- Symbolic rupture and collapse modeling
- Supports high-dimensional reality inputs (e.g., embeddings)
- Export cognition logs (`.json`, `.csv`) for external audits
- Control layer for hallucination detection in LLMs or symbolic gating in agents
- Minimal, extensible, domain-agnostic
- Built with symbolic state logic — extensible for memory, attention, or projection systems

## Installation

```bash
pip install cognize
```

## Core Concepts

| Symbol | Meaning                |
|--------|------------------------|
| `V`    | Projection (belief)    |
| `R`    | Reality (signal)       |
| `∆`    | Distortion             |
| `Θ`    | Tolerance threshold    |
| `E`    | Misalignment memory    |
| `⊙`    | Stable                 |
| `⚠`    | Rupture                |
| `∅`    | No signal yet          |

---

## Example Usage

```python
from cognize import EpistemicState

# Scalar-based epistemic drift tracking
e = EpistemicState(V0=0.0, threshold=0.4)

for R in [0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8]:
    e.receive(R)
    print(e.symbol(), e.summary())

# Access rolling drift statistics
print(e.drift_stats(window=3))

# Trigger fallback if cognitive rupture risk is too high
e.intervene_if_ruptured(lambda: print("⚠ Intervention triggered!"))

# Manually realign belief to current signal
e.realign(R=0.7)

# Export logs
e.export_json("cognition.json")
e.export_csv("cognition.csv")


```

**Expected Output:**

```
⊙ {'V': 0.03, 'E': 0.01, 'Θ': 0.4, ...}
⊙ {...}
⚠ {'V': 0.0, 'E': 0.0, 'Θ': 0.4, ...}
{'mean_drift': 0.24, 'std_drift': 0.13, 'max_drift': 0.3, 'min_drift': 0.1}
⚠ Intervention triggered!

```

**Sample cognition.json output:**

```
[
  {
    "t": 0,
    "V": 0.03,
    "R": 0.1,
    "delta": 0.1,
    "Θ": 0.4,
    "ruptured": false,
    "symbol": "⊙",
    "source": "default"
  },
  ...
]

```

Cognize also supports vector input (e.g. NumPy arrays) for multi-dimensional drift modeling — useful for embeddings or continuous signals.
