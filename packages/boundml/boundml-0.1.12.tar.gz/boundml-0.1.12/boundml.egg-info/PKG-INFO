# BoundML

BoundML is a wrapper around a [fork of ecole](https://github.com/sirenard/ecole).
It allows to easily develop new machine learning based branching strategies based for the Branch and Bound.

## Installation

First, it is recommended to install `pyscipopt` and the different dependencies with conda to have the same scip installation
for `pyscipopt` and `ecole-fork` (on which is based `boundml`).

```
conda install pyscipopt fmt pybind11

export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="${CONDA_PREFIX}"      
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="${CONDA_PREFIX}/include/"
export LIBRARY_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib

pip install boundml
```
The exports commands allow the compiler to find SCIP.

To install range-v3 for a ubuntu ditribution:

```
sudo apt install librange-v3-dev librange-v3-doc
```

## Example

The file [gnn_pipeline](example/gnn_pipeline.py) shows how tu use this library to reproduce easily the work of
[Gasse et al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01629). It consists of training a GCNN to learn to imitate strong branching.
