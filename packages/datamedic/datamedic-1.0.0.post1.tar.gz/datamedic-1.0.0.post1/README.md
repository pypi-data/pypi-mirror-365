## 📦 Sample Workflow

### Step 1: Clean the data
```datamedic clean data.csv --fillna mean --fix-cols --dropdupe -o cleaned.csv```

### Step 2: Encode categorical columns
```datamedic encode cleaned.csv --method onehot -o encoded.csv```

### Step 3: Scale the numerical features
```datamedic scale encoded.csv --method standard -o scaled.csv```

### Step 4: Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction
```datamedic pca scaled.csv --components 5 -o reduced.csv```

### Step 5: Detect possible data leakage
```datamedic leakage reduced.csv --target sale_price```

### Step 6: Generate an automated EDA report
```
datamedic eda cleaned.csv
```
✨ Key Features
• Intuitive CLI interface with structured command options

• Optional column targeting for all major operations

• PCA with component or variance threshold options

• Detailed summary and fallback backups at each step

• Graphs and automated insights from EDA

## Testing & Reliability
This tool has been tested with over 50+ CLI test cases across real-world and edge scenarios.
Verified by early-stage testers from diverse backgrounds.

datamedic ensures that your preprocessing is both robust and repeatable.

## 🧪 Troubleshooting
1. 'Command Not Found': Restart terminal or use pip install -e . in dev mode.
2. UnicodeDecodeError: Try --encoding utf-8 while loading file.
3. PCA Warning Despite Scaling: Ensure scaling is done using datamedic scale.
4. CLI Flags Not Working: Pass comma-separated columns like --columns age,salary.
