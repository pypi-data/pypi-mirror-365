"""
Python package for machine learning in communication.

This package is broken up into several modules, each tasked with only a single
part of the whole communication system. Each module shall work independently of
each other, except modules like `utils` and `functional`. Processing blocks of the
communication system shall be implemented as modular blocks and within
simulations it should be possible to chain output of a preceeding block
to the input of the next block.

This package implements blocks either for PyTorch or TensorFlow, most
functionality is implemented exclusively in one of the frameworks.
In the case of TensorFlow the functions are implemented in conjunction
with the framework sionna.
