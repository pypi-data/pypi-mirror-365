			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core CLI Framework with Click",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the CLI framework implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Project structure setup and Click dependency installation, 2) Main CLI entry point with command group setup, 3) Individual command implementations (init, validate, version), 4) Custom exception hierarchy creation, 5) Console output utilities with Rich integration, 6) Error handling and exit code management, 7) Entry point configuration in pyproject.toml, 8) Comprehensive CLI testing with CliRunner",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating the foundational CLI architecture with multiple commands, custom error handling, rich console output, and proper packaging setup. The complexity comes from integrating Click and Rich frameworks, implementing proper error handling patterns, and ensuring a good user experience with colored output and progress bars."

			"reasoning": "While conceptually straightforward, this task involves handling multiple file types with specific formatting requirements, implementing atomic writes for safety, managing file permissions (especially for executables), and supporting dry-run mode throughout. The variety of file types and safety requirements add complexity."

		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create Starter Template",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize starter template creation: 1) Set up starter template directory structure, 2) Create template.yaml with metadata and minimal configuration, 3) Implement CLAUDE.md.j2 with universal sections and placeholders, 4) Build settings.json.j2 with minimal safe permissions, 5) Create example format-on-save hook with cross-platform compatibility",
			"reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward task focused on creating content rather than complex logic. The main considerations are ensuring the template is truly universal, maintaining cross-platform compatibility for the hook, and keeping the configuration minimal yet useful."
