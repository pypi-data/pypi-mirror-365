Configuration
=============

This module provides a number of default risk categories, but you can
add more at *Project > Configuration > Risk Categories*. For risk
response categories you need to go to *Project > Configuration > Risk
Response Categories*.

Usage
=====

To define risks for your projects:

1. Go to *Project > Risks*;

2. create a new risk;

3. | the rating is automatically calculated based on this risk matrix:
   | |Risk matrix|

4. set the state to 'Active' if the risk is in effect;

5. set the state to 'Closed' if the risk is processed or e.g. completely
   avoided.

The list of risks is by default ordered by rating and proximity. Risks
with a rating higher than rating 'Medium-High' become red.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- Create a task based on a risk response: it would be nice if a task can
  automatically be created based on the risk response information.
