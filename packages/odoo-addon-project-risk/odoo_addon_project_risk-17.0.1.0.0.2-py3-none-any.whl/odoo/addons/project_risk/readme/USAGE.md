To define risks for your projects:

1.  Go to *Project \> Risks*;

2.  create a new risk;

3.  the rating is automatically calculated based on this risk matrix:  
    ![Risk matrix](../static/description/matrix.png)

4.  set the state to 'Active' if the risk is in effect;

5.  set the state to 'Closed' if the risk is processed or e.g.
    completely avoided.

The list of risks is by default ordered by rating and proximity. Risks
with a rating higher than rating 'Medium-High' become red.
