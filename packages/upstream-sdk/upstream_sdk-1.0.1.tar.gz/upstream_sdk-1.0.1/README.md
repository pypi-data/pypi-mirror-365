# Upstream Python SDK

A Python SDK for seamless integration with the Upstream environmental sensor data platform and CKAN data portal.

## Overview

The Upstream Python SDK provides a standardized, production-ready toolkit for environmental researchers and organizations to:

- **Authenticate** with Upstream API and CKAN data portals
- **Manage** environmental monitoring campaigns and stations
- **Upload** sensor data efficiently (with automatic chunking for large datasets)
- **Publish** datasets automatically to CKAN for discoverability
- **Automate** data pipelines for continuous sensor networks

## Key Features

### 🔐 **Unified Authentication**

- Seamless integration with Upstream API and Tapis/CKAN
- Automatic token management and refresh
- Secure credential handling

### 📊 **Complete Data Workflow**

```python
from upstream.client import UpstreamClient
from upstream_api_client.models import CampaignsIn, StationCreate
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Initialize client with CKAN integration
client = UpstreamClient(
    username="researcher",
    password="password",
    base_url="https://upstream-dso.tacc.utexas.edu",
    ckan_url="https://ckan.tacc.utexas.edu",
    ckan_organization="your-org"
)

# Create campaign
campaign_data = CampaignsIn(
    name="Environmental Monitoring 2024",
    description="Environmental monitoring campaign with multi-sensor stations",
    contact_name="Dr. Jane Smith",
    contact_email="jane.smith@university.edu",
    allocation="TACC",
    start_date=datetime.now(),
    end_date=datetime.now() + timedelta(days=365)
)
campaign = client.create_campaign(campaign_data)

# Create monitoring station
station_data = StationCreate(
    name="Downtown Air Quality Monitor",
    description="Multi-sensor environmental monitoring station",
    contact_name="Dr. Jane Smith",
    contact_email="jane.smith@university.edu",
    start_date=datetime.now()
)
station = client.create_station(campaign.id, station_data)

# Upload sensor data
result = client.upload_csv_data(
    campaign_id=campaign.id,
    station_id=station.id,
    sensors_file="sensors.csv",
    measurements_file="measurements.csv"
)

print(f"Uploaded {result['response']['Total sensors processed']} sensors")
print(f"Added {result['response']['Total measurements added to database']} measurements")

# Publish to CKAN with rich metadata
publication = client.publish_to_ckan(
    campaign_id=campaign.id,
    station_id=station.id
)
print(f"Data published at: {publication['ckan_url']}")
```

### 🚀 **Production-Ready Features**

- **Type-safe interfaces** with Pydantic models and comprehensive validation
- **Rich statistics** - automatic calculation of sensor measurement statistics
- **Comprehensive error handling** with specific exception types (`APIError`, `ValidationError`)
- **CKAN integration** with custom metadata support and automatic resource management
- **Modular architecture** with dedicated managers for campaigns, stations, and sensors
- **Extensive logging** and debugging capabilities
- **Authentication management** with automatic token handling

### 🔄 **CKAN Integration & Publishing**

Seamless data publishing to CKAN portals:

```python
# Publish with custom metadata
publication_result = client.publish_to_ckan(
    campaign_id=campaign_id,
    station_id=station_id,

    # Custom dataset metadata
    dataset_metadata={
        "project_name": "Air Quality Study",
        "funding_agency": "EPA",
        "grant_number": "EPA-2024-001"
    },

    # Custom resource metadata
    resource_metadata={
        "calibration_date": "2024-01-15",
        "quality_control": "Automated + Manual Review",
        "uncertainty_bounds": "±2% of reading"
    },

    # Custom tags for discoverability
    custom_tags=["air-quality", "epa-funded", "quality-controlled"]
)

print(f"Dataset published: {publication_result['ckan_url']}")
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Basic Setup

```python
from upstream.client import UpstreamClient

# Initialize with credentials and CKAN integration
client = UpstreamClient(
    username="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    base_url="https://upstream-dso.tacc.utexas.edu",
    ckan_url="https://ckan.tacc.utexas.edu",
    ckan_organization="your-org"
)

# Test authentication
if client.authenticate():
    print("✅ Connected successfully!")
```

### 2. Create Campaign

```python
from upstream.campaigns import CampaignManager
from upstream_api_client.models import CampaignsIn
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Initialize campaign manager
campaign_manager = CampaignManager(client.auth_manager)

campaign_data = CampaignsIn(
    name="Environmental Monitoring 2024",
    description="Multi-sensor environmental monitoring network",
    contact_name="Dr. Jane Smith",
    contact_email="jane.smith@university.edu",
    allocation="TACC",
    start_date=datetime.now(),
    end_date=datetime.now() + timedelta(days=365)
)
campaign = campaign_manager.create(campaign_data)
print(f"Campaign created with ID: {campaign.id}")
```

### 3. Register Monitoring Station

```python
from upstream.stations import StationManager
from upstream_api_client.models import StationCreate

    contact_name="Dr. Jane Smith",
    contact_email="jane.smith@university.edu",
    start_date=datetime.now()
)
station = station_manager.create(
    campaign_id=campaign.id,
    station_create=station_data
)
print(f"Station created with ID: {station.id}")
```

### 4. Upload Sensor Data

```python
# Upload from CSV files

    campaign_id=campaign.id,
    station_id=station.id,
    sensors_file="path/to/sensors.csv",
    measurements_file="path/to/measurements.csv"
)

# Access detailed results
response = result['response']
print(f"Sensors processed: {response['Total sensors processed']}")

## Advanced Usage

### Sensor Analytics and Statistics

```python
# Get sensor statistics after upload
sensors = client.sensors.list(campaign_id=campaign_id, station_id=station_id)

for sensor in sensors.items:
    stats = sensor.statistics
    print(f"Sensor: {sensor.alias} ({sensor.variablename})")
    print(f"  Measurements: {stats.count}")
    print(f"  Range: {stats.min_value:.2f} - {stats.max_value:.2f} {sensor.units}")
    print(f"  Average: {stats.avg_value:.2f} {sensor.units}")
    print(f"  Std Dev: {stats.stddev_value:.3f}")
    print(f"  Last value: {stats.last_measurement_value:.2f}")
    print(f"  Updated: {stats.stats_last_updated}")
```

### Error Handling and Validation

```python
from upstream.exceptions import APIError, ValidationError
from upstream.campaigns import CampaignManager
from upstream.stations import StationManager

try:
    # Initialize managers
    campaign_manager = CampaignManager(client.auth_manager)
    station_manager = StationManager(client.auth_manager)

    # Create campaign with validation
    campaign = campaign_manager.create(campaign_data)
    station = station_manager.create(
        campaign_id=str(campaign.id),
        station_create=station_data
    )

except ValidationError as e:
    print(f"Data validation failed: {e}")
except APIError as e:
    print(f"API error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
```

### Comprehensive Data Upload

```python
# Upload with detailed response handling
result = client.upload_csv_data(
    campaign_id=campaign.id,
    station_id=station.id,
    sensors_file="path/to/sensors.csv",
    measurements_file="path/to/measurements.csv"
)

# Access detailed upload information
response = result['response']
print(f"Sensors processed: {response['Total sensors processed']}")
print(f"Measurements added: {response['Total measurements added to database']}")
print(f"Processing time: {response['Data Processing time']}")
print(f"Files stored: {response['uploaded_file_sensors stored in memory']}")
```

### Automated Data Pipeline

```python
# Complete automated workflow
def automated_monitoring_pipeline():
    try:
        # List existing campaigns and stations
        campaigns = client.list_campaigns(limit=5)
        if campaigns.items:
            campaign = campaigns.items[0]
            stations = client.list_stations(campaign_id=str(campaign.id))

            if stations.items:
                station = stations.items[0]

                # Upload new sensor data
                result = client.upload_csv_data(
                    campaign_id=campaign.id,
                    station_id=station.id,
                    sensors_file="latest_sensors.csv",
                    measurements_file="latest_measurements.csv"
                )

                # Publish to CKAN automatically
                publication = client.publish_to_ckan(
                    campaign_id=campaign.id,
                    station_id=station.id,
                    custom_tags=["automated", "real-time"]
                )

                print(f"Pipeline completed: {publication['ckan_url']}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Pipeline error: {e}")
        # Implement alerting/retry logic
