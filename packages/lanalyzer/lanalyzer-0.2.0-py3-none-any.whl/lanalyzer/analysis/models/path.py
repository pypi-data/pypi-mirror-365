"""
Path-sensitive analysis models.

This module contains data structures for path-sensitive analysis,
including PathNode for tracking execution paths and constraints.

The module now includes a constraint propagation algorithm that can
determine path reachability by analyzing constraint satisfiability.

Supported constraint types:
- Boolean constraints: x == True, x is None
- Comparison constraints: x > 0, x <= 5
- Membership constraints: x in list, hasattr(x, 'attr')
- Type constraints: isinstance(x, str)
- Logical combinations: and, or, not

The constraint solver uses a simplified propagation algorithm that
focuses on detecting obvious contradictions while maintaining good
performance for static analysis scenarios.
