# BadgeQuest Future Enhancements

This document tracks potential future improvements and features for BadgeQuest.

## Security Enhancements

### API Authentication
Currently, the `/progress` endpoints are public. For production deployments with sensitive data, consider adding:

1. **API Key Authentication**
   - Issue unique API keys to each lecturer
   - Require API key header for progress endpoints
   - Example: `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>`

2. **IP Whitelisting**
   - Restrict access to known university IP ranges
   - Configure at nginx/firewall level

3. **Basic Authentication**
   - Add HTTP Basic Auth to progress endpoints
   - Simple username/password for lecturers

4. **OAuth2 Integration**
   - Integrate with university SSO
   - Use existing lecturer credentials

### Implementation Example (API Keys):
```python
# In config.py
API_KEYS = {
    "lecturer1": "key-hash-here",
    "lecturer2": "key-hash-here"
}

# In app.py
def require_api_key(f):
    @wraps(f)
    def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
        api_key = request.headers.get('X-API-Key')
        if not api_key or api_key not in valid_keys:
            return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid API key'}), 401
        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return decorated_function

@app.route("/api/progress/bulk", methods=["POST"])
@require_api_key
def bulk_progress():
    # ... existing code
```
