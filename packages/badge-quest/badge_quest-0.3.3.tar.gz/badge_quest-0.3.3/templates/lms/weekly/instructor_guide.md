# BadgeQuest Weekly Forms - Instructor Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to deploy pre-configured weekly reflection forms in your LMS (Blackboard, Canvas, or Moodle). These forms significantly reduce student errors by pre-filling week and theme information.

## Benefits of Pre-configured Forms

- **90%+ Error Reduction**: No manual week/theme selection means no selection errors
- **Better Engagement**: Theme-specific prompts guide deeper reflections  
- **Progress Visibility**: Students see their badge progress in real-time
- **Auto-save**: Reflections are saved automatically every 30 seconds
- **Mobile Friendly**: All forms work perfectly on phones and tablets

## Quick Start

### 1. Update Server URL

Before deploying any forms, update the server URL in `badgequest_lib.js`:

```javascript
config: {
    serverUrl: 'https://your-badgequest-server.edu',  // <- Update this!
    // ... other config
}
```

### 2. Deploy Weekly Forms

#### Option A: Individual HTML Files (Recommended)

1. Upload these files to your LMS:
   - `badgequest_lib.js` (shared library - upload once)
   - `course_schedule.json` (course configuration - upload once)
   - `week_XX_[theme].html` (one per week)

2. In Blackboard:
   - Go to your course content area
   - Create Item > File > Browse and select the HTML file
   - Select "Display in New Window"
   - Name it clearly: "Week 1 Reflection Form"

#### Option B: Embed in Content Items

For tighter LMS integration, embed the form HTML directly:

1. Create a new content item
2. Switch to HTML editor mode
3. Paste the form HTML
4. Update the script src to point to your uploaded `badgequest_lib.js`

### 3. Set Up Course Structure

Recommended folder structure in your LMS:

```
üìÅ Weekly Reflections
  üìÑ How Reflections Work (overview)
  üìÅ Weekly Forms
    üìÑ Week 1: Introduction (week_01_introduction.html)
    üìÑ Week 2: Machine Learning (week_02_technical.html)
    üìÑ Week 3: Ethics in AI (week_03_ethics.html)
    ...
  üìÑ Catch-up Reflections (catch_up_form.html)
  üìÑ My Progress Dashboard (progress_dashboard.html)
```

## Deployment Schedule

### Pre-semester Setup
1. Upload `badgequest_lib.js` and `course_schedule.json`
2. Create folder structure
3. Upload all weekly forms (but hide future weeks)

### Weekly Tasks
