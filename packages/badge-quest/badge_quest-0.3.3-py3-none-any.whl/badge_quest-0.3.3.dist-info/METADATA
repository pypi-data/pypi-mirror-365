# BadgeQuest üèÜ

> Collect, learn, repeat.

BadgeQuest is a gamified reflection system designed for Learning Management Systems (LMS). It transforms student reflections into meaningful achievements through an engaging badge progression system.

## Features

- **Weekly Reflection Tracking**: Students submit reflections that are validated for quality
- **Smart Validation**: Checks word count, readability, sentiment, and uniqueness
- **Similarity Detection**: Prevents resubmission of previous reflections with minor changes (80% threshold)
- **Badge Progression**: Earn badges from "Dabbler" to "Mastery" based on consistent participation
- **Micro-Credentials**: Theme-based achievements for focused reflection topics (e.g., AI Ethics Explorer, Innovation Champion)
- **LMS Integration**: Ready-to-use HTML forms for Blackboard (Canvas and Moodle coming soon)
- **Instructor Tools**: Generate progress reports for easy grade center uploads
- **Privacy-First**: Only stores anonymized data with hashed reflections
- **Configurable**: Support multiple courses with custom badge themes and micro-credentials

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install badge-quest

# Or with uv (recommended)
uv pip install badge-quest
```

### Running the Server

```bash
# Initialize the database
badgequest init-db

# Start the Flask server
badgequest run-server --port 5000
```

### For Instructors

1. Extract the LMS form template:
```bash
badgequest extract-lms blackboard --output form.html
```

2. Generate progress reports:
```bash
badgequest generate-progress --students students.txt --course AI101 --output badges.csv
```

## Configuration

BadgeQuest supports course-specific configurations through environment variables:

```bash
# .env file
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///reflections.db
CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-lms.edu
```

## Badge Levels

The default badge progression:

| Weeks | Badge | Title |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 1 | üß™ | Dabbler |
| 3 | ü•æ | Explorer |
| 5 | üß† | Thinker |
| 7 | üõ°Ô∏è | Warrior |
| 10 | üõ†Ô∏è | Builder |
| 12 | üó£Ô∏è | Explainer |
| 14+ | üèÜ | Mastery |

### Micro-Credentials

Students can earn theme-based micro-credentials by submitting reflections with specific themes. Example configuration:

```python
"micro_credentials": {
    "ethics_explorer": {
        "name": "AI Ethics Explorer",
        "emoji": "‚öñÔ∏è",
        "description": "Demonstrated strong ethical analysis in AI reflections",
        "themes": ["ethics", "responsibility"],
        "min_submissions": 2
    }
}
```

## API Endpoints
