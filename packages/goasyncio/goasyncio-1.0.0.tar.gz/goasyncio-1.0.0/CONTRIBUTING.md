- Git
- Basic knowledge of async programming

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coffeecms/goasyncio.git
   cd goasyncio
   ```

2. **Create Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Development Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev,test]
   ```

4. **Install Pre-commit Hooks**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

5. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -v
   ```

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use Black for formatting
- **Go**: Follow Go conventions, use `gofmt`
- **Documentation**: Use Google-style docstrings
- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for Python code

### Code Formatting

```bash
# Format Python code
black goasyncio/

# Format Go code
cd go && gofmt -s -w .

# Lint Python code
flake8 goasyncio/

# Type check
mypy goasyncio/
```

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain 90%+ code coverage
- Use meaningful test names
- Include both unit and integration tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=goasyncio --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/ -m "performance"
pytest tests/ -m "integration"
```
