## Class Names Preserved
The following class names were kept with capital letters as they are proper Python class names:
- `ChattyBot` class in `cli.py` - This remains capitalized as it's a class name

## Result
- All user-facing text now uses lowercase "chatty"
- All documentation uses lowercase "chatty"
- All CLI output uses lowercase "chatty"
- Python class names remain properly capitalized
- Package functionality remains unchanged
- All tests still pass

The package now consistently uses lowercase "chatty" throughout while maintaining proper Python naming conventions for classes.
