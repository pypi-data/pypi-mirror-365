2.0.0 — 2024-01-17

  boolean values a configured.
  Specifically, the value for the configuration field `bot_post_media` needs to be changed from "True" or "False"
  to `true`, or `false` respectively.

Added
-----

  (Details see PRs #18 and #19)

1.0.0 — 2023-12-07
==================

  `--config-file` nominates the existing old-style config file, while
  `--config-json` nominates the new style config file to be generated.
