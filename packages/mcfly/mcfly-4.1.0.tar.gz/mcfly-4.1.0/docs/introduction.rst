Introduction
============

The goal of mcfly is to ease the use of deep learning technology for
time series classification and regression. The advantage of deep learning is that it
can handle raw data directly, without the need to compute signal
features. Deep learning does not require expert domain knowledge about
the data, and has been shown to be competitive with conventional machine
learning techniques. As an example, you can apply mcfly on accelerometer
data for activity classification, as shown in `the
tutorial <https://github.com/NLeSC/mcfly-tutorial>`__.
