"""
Main entry point for the Speaker Diarization & Splitting System.

This script is designed for standardization and simply executes the core logic
from the `split_speakers.py` script. Running this script is equivalent to
running `split_speakers.py` directly.

Any command-line arguments provided to `main.py` will be automatically
passed along to the underlying script.

Usage:
    python main.py [speakers] [--verbose]

Example:
    python main.py 2 --verbose
