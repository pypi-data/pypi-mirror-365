# ===================================================================================
# SETUP SCRIPT FOR SPEAKER DIARIZATION
# ===================================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
# This script sets up the Python virtual environment for the speaker diarization
# project. It intelligently detects your hardware (NVIDIA GPU) and installs the
# correct dependencies.
#
# USAGE:
# This script is designed to be run with 'uv', a fast Python package manager.
#
# 1. Create a new virtual environment:
#    uv venv .venv --seed
#
# 2. Activate the environment:
#    .venv\Scripts\activate
#
# 3. Run this setup script:
#    python setup.py
#
#
# --- MODES OF OPERATION ---
#
# 1. Default Mode (Recommended First Try):
#    COMMAND: python setup.py
#    - This installs the LATEST available versions of all required libraries.
#    - Use this mode to get the newest features and bug fixes. This should be
#      your first choice when setting up the project.
#
# 2. Failsafe Mode (The Stable Backup):
#    COMMAND: python setup.py --failsafe
#    - This installs a specific, locked-down set of library versions from the
#      `requirements.txt` file. These versions are known to be stable and
#      work together correctly.
#    - Use this mode if the default installation (with the latest libraries)
#      is causing unexpected errors or crashes. This is the "it just works" option.
