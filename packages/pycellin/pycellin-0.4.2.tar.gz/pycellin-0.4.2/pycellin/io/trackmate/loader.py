    """
    Read a TrackMate XML file and convert the tracks data to directed acyclic graphs.

    Each TrackMate track and its associated data described in the XML file
    are modeled as networkX directed graphs. Spots are modeled as graph
    nodes, and edges as graph edges. Spot, edge and track features are
    stored in node, edge and graph attributes, respectively.
    The rest of the information contained in the XML file is stored either
    as a metadata dict (TrackMate version, log, settings...) or in the Model
    features declaration.

    Parameters
    ----------
    xml_path : str
        Path of the XML file to process.
    keep_all_spots : bool, optional
        True to keep the spots filtered out in TrackMate, False otherwise.
        False by default.
    keep_all_tracks : bool, optional
        True to keep the tracks filtered out in TrackMate, False otherwise.
        False by default.
