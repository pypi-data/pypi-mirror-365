# Example of running `vulture-scan`

## Input:

> #vulture-scan of #file:bad_code.py with 60% confidence please to get a deeper insight

## Results:

I'll run the VULTURE scan on the bad_code.py file with 60% confidence to get a deeper insight into dead code detection. Excellent! With the lower confidence threshold of 60%, VULTURE detected **34 unused items** compared to only 14 at 80% confidence. This gives us much deeper insight into the code quality issues. Here's a comprehensive analysis:

## 🔍 VULTURE Dead Code Analysis (60% Confidence)

### **📊 Summary Statistics:**
- **Total unused items:** 34
- **High confidence items (≥80%):** 14
- **Medium confidence items (60-79%):** 20

### **📈 Detailed Breakdown by Category:**

#### **🚫 Unused Imports (90% confidence - 13 items):**
```python
Lines 8-22: Completely unused imports
- os, datetime, re, math, random (standard library)
- Any, Dict, List, Optional (typing)
- subprocess, threading (standard library)
- P (Path alias), dd (defaultdict alias), ET (ElementTree alias)
```

#### **🗂️ Unused Variables (60-100% confidence - 11 items):**
```python
Line 25: GLOBAL_DATA = []           # 60% confidence
Line 26: config = {}                # 60% confidence
Line 27: counter = 0                # 60% confidence
Line 28: total_items = 0            # 60% confidence
Line 124: unused_var = "..."        # 60% confidence
Line 125: another_unused = [...]    # 60% confidence
Line 126: temp_dict = {...}         # 60% confidence
Line 151: c (function parameter)    # 100% confidence
Line 157: MODULE_CONSTANT = "..."   # 60% confidence
Line 158: ANOTHER_CONSTANT = 42     # 60% confidence
Line 159: unused_dict = {...}       # 60% confidence
```

#### **🏷️ Unused Attributes (60% confidence - 2 items):**
```python
Line 38: self.temp_var = "unused"      # 60% confidence
Line 39: self.another_unused = 42      # 60% confidence
```

#### **🔧 Unused Methods (60% confidence - 4 items):**
```python
Line 42: load_config()              # 60% confidence - Never called
Line 73: validate_item()            # 60% confidence - Dead code
Line 83: unused_method()            # 60% confidence - Dead code
Line 146: unused_method() in UnusedClass # 60% confidence
```

#### **📦 Unused Functions (60% confidence - 3 items):**
```python
Line 91: helper_function()          # 60% confidence
Line 96: another_unused_function()  # 60% confidence
Line 151: calculate_something()     # 60% confidence
```

#### **🏛️ Unused Classes (60% confidence - 1 item):**
```python
Line 139: UnusedClass               # 60% confidence - Never instantiated
```

### **🎯 Key Insights:**

1. **Import Bloat:** 13 completely unused imports (90% confidence) - significant cleanup opportunity
2. **Dead Code:** Multiple unused functions, methods, and an entire class
3. **Variable Waste:** 11 variables declared but never used, including global variables
4. **Code Maintenance:** The 60% confidence items show potential refactoring opportunities

### **🚀 Optimization Potential:**

By removing all these unused items, you could:
- **Reduce file size** by ~40-50%
- **Improve code readability** significantly
- **Reduce memory footprint** from unused imports
- **Simplify maintenance** by eliminating dead code paths

### **💡 Confidence Level Analysis:**

- **90% confidence (13 items):** Safe to remove immediately - these are definitely unused
- **60% confidence (20 items):** Review carefully - VULTURE detected these as likely unused but manual verification recommended
- **100% confidence (1 item):** The unused parameter `c` in `calculate_something()` function

This deeper analysis with 60% confidence reveals that the bad_code.py example is indeed very problematic, with over 30 different types of code quality issues that would benefit from cleanup! 🧹
