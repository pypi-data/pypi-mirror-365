2. **CHANGELOG.md** - Version tracking and release notes (initialized with v0.1.0)
3. **.github/workflows/publish.yml** - GitHub Actions workflow for automated PyPI publishing
4. **release.py** - Local release management script with full automation
5. **README.md** - Enhanced with installation instructions and development setup
6. **requirements.txt** - Added build tools (`build`, `twine`)
