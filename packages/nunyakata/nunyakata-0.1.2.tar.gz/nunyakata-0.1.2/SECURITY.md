# Security Policy

## Overview

The `nunyakata` library handles sensitive operations including payment processing, SMS messaging, and email communications through various Ghana-based APIs. We take security seriously and are committed to ensuring the safety and privacy of our users' data.

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported | End of Life |
| ------- | --------- | ----------- |
| 0.1.x   | ✅ Yes    | TBD         |
| < 0.1.0 | ❌ No     | 2025-01-01  |

**Note**: We recommend always using the latest stable version to ensure you have the most recent security patches.

## Security Features

### 🔐 Built-in Security Measures

- **Credential Protection**: Secure handling of API keys, passwords, and authentication tokens
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All API communications use secure HTTPS connections
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- **Session Management**: Secure USSD session handling with proper cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses that don't expose sensitive information

### 🛡️ Recommended Security Practices

When using `nunyakata` in your applications:

1. **Environment Variables**: Store all sensitive credentials in environment variables, never in code
2. **Access Controls**: Implement proper access controls for API endpoints
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. **Logging**: Avoid logging sensitive data (credentials, phone numbers, amounts)
5. **Network Security**: Use secure networks and consider VPN for production deployments

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: [Repository Security Tab](https://github.com/SeveighTech/nunyakata/security/advisories)
- **PyPI Security Notifications**: Automatic notifications for package updates
- **Documentation**: Security updates will be documented in `CHANGELOG.md`

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

### 🤝 Our Commitments

We commit to:

1. **Acknowledge** your report within the specified timeframes
2. **Investigate** the issue thoroughly and keep you updated on progress
3. **Credit** security researchers in our advisories (if desired)
4. **Not pursue legal action** against researchers who follow responsible disclosure
5. **Prioritize** security fixes based on severity and impact

### 🔒 Researcher Guidelines

We ask security researchers to:

1. **Report** vulnerabilities privately before public disclosure
2. **Avoid** accessing, modifying, or deleting user data
3. **Minimize** impact during vulnerability research
4. **Not perform** testing on production systems without permission
5. **Give us reasonable time** to address issues before public disclosure

## Security-Related Dependencies

### 🔍 Dependency Monitoring

We actively monitor our dependencies for security vulnerabilities:

- **Automated Scanning**: GitHub Dependabot alerts
- **Regular Updates**: Monthly dependency reviews
- **Security Patches**: Immediate updates for critical vulnerabilities

### 📦 Key Security Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose                  | Security Notes                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `requests` | HTTP client              | Handles TLS/SSL for secure API communications    |
| `hashlib`  | Cryptographic hashing    | Used for secure API authentication               |
| `secrets`  | Secure random generation | Generates cryptographically secure random values |

## API Security Considerations

### 🏦 Payment API Security

- **PCI DSS Compliance**: While we don't store card data, we follow secure coding practices
- **Authentication**: Secure MD5-based authentication as required by Nalo Solutions
- **Callback Validation**: Proper validation of payment callbacks

### 📱 SMS/Communication Security

- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protections against SMS spam
- **Input Sanitization**: Prevention of SMS injection attacks
- **Delivery Tracking**: Secure handling of delivery status callbacks

### 🔐 Credential Management

- **No Storage**: Library doesn't persist credentials
- **Secure Transmission**: All credentials sent over HTTPS
- **Environment Variables**: Recommended storage method for credentials

## Security Best Practices for Developers

### 🛠️ Development Guidelines

1. **Code Reviews**: All changes require security-focused code review
2. **Static Analysis**: Regular use of security linting tools
3. **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning
4. **Test Coverage**: Security-related functionality must have test coverage

### 📚 Secure Implementation Examples

```python
# ✅ Good: Using environment variables
from nunyakata import load_nalo_client_from_env
client = load_nalo_client_from_env()

# ❌ Bad: Hardcoded credentials
client = NaloSolutions(
    payment_username="hardcoded_user",  # Never do this!
    payment_password="hardcoded_pass"   # Never do this!
)

# ✅ Good: Proper error handling
try:
    response = client.send_sms(phone, message)
    if response.get('status') == 'success':
        # Handle success
        pass
    else:
        # Handle error without exposing details
        logger.error("SMS sending failed")
except Exception as e:
    # Log error without sensitive data
    logger.error(f"SMS error: {type(e).__name__}")
```
