    def hypersimp(self, k):
        r"""Given combinatorial term f(k) simplify its consecutive term ratio

        integer sequences which have equivalent representation in terms
        of gamma special function.
        
        Explanation
        ===========
        
        The algorithm performs three basic steps:
        
        1. Rewrite all functions in terms of gamma, if possible.
        
        2. Rewrite all occurrences of gamma in terms of products
           of gamma and rising factorial with integer,  absolute
           constant exponent.
        
        3. Perform simplification of nested fractions, powers
           and if the resulting expression is a quotient of
           polynomials, reduce their total degree.
        
        If f(k) is hypergeometric then as result we arrive with a
        quotient of polynomials of minimal degree. Otherwise None
        is returned.

    def logcombine(self, force=False):

        Takes logarithms and combines them using the following rules:
        
        - log(x) + log(y) == log(x*y) if both are positive
        - a*log(x) == log(x**a) if x is positive and a is real
        
        If ``force`` is ``True`` then the assumptions above will be assumed to hold if
        there is no assumption already in place on a quantity. For example, if
        ``a`` is imaginary or the argument negative, force will not perform a
        combination but if ``a`` is a symbol with no assumptions the change will
        take place.

    def nsolve(self, *args, dict=False, **kwargs):

        Solve a nonlinear equation system numerically: ``nsolve(f, [args,] x0,
        modules=['mpmath'], **kwargs)``.
        
        Explanation
        ===========
        
        ``f`` is a vector function of symbolic expressions representing the system.
        *args* are the variables. If there is only one variable, this argument can
        be omitted. ``x0`` is a starting vector close to a solution.
        
        Use the modules keyword to specify which modules should be used to
        evaluate the function and the Jacobian matrix. Make sure to use a module
        that supports matrices. For more information on the syntax, please see the
        docstring of ``lambdify``.
        
        If the keyword arguments contain ``dict=True`` (default is False) ``nsolve``
        will return a list (perhaps empty) of solution mappings. This might be
        especially useful if you want to use ``nsolve`` as a fallback to solve since
        using the dict argument for both methods produces return values of
        consistent type structure. Please note: to keep this consistent with
        ``solve``, the solution will be returned in a list even though ``nsolve``
        (currently at least) only finds one solution at a time.
        
        Overdetermined systems are supported.

        max_len : maximum number of surds passed as constants to ``nsimplify``
        
        Algorithm
        =========
        
        First ``nsimplify`` is used to get a candidate root; if it is not a
        root the minimal polynomial is computed; the answer is one of its
        roots.
        """
    def powdenest(self, force=False, polar=False):
        r"""
        Collect exponents on powers as assumptions allow.
        
        Explanation
        ===========
        
        Given ``(bb**be)**e``, this can be simplified as follows:
            * if ``bb`` is positive, or
            * ``e`` is an integer, or
            * ``|be| < 1`` then this simplifies to ``bb**(be*e)``
        
        Given a product of powers raised to a power, ``(bb1**be1 *
        bb2**be2...)**e``, simplification can be done as follows:
        
        - if e is positive, the gcd of all bei can be joined with e;
        - all non-negative bb can be separated from those that are negative
          and their gcd can be joined with e; autosimplification already
          handles this separation.
        - integer factors from powers that have integers in the denominator
          of the exponent can be removed from any term and the gcd of such
          integers can be joined with e
        
        Setting ``force`` to ``True`` will make symbols that are not explicitly
        negative behave as though they are positive, resulting in more
        denesting.
        
        Setting ``polar`` to ``True`` will do simplifications on the Riemann surface of
        the logarithm, also resulting in more denestings.
        
        When there are sums of logs in exp() then a product of powers may be
        obtained e.g. ``exp(3*(log(a) + 2*log(b)))`` - > ``a**3*b**6``.

    def separatevars(self, symbols=[], dict=False, force=False):
        r"""
        Separates variables in an expression, if possible.  By
        default, it separates with respect to all symbols in an
        expression and collects constant coefficients that are
        independent of symbols.
        
        Explanation
        ===========
        
        If ``dict=True`` then the separated terms will be returned
        in a dictionary keyed to their corresponding symbols.
        By default, all symbols in the expression will appear as
        keys; if symbols are provided, then all those symbols will
        be used as keys, and any terms in the expression containing
        other symbols or non-symbols will be returned keyed to the
        string 'coeff'. (Passing None for symbols will return the
        expression in a dictionary keyed to 'coeff'.)
        
        If ``force=True``, then bases of powers will be separated regardless
        of assumptions on the symbols involved.
        
        Notes
        =====
        
        The order of the factors is determined by Mul, so that the
        separated expressions may not necessarily be grouped together.
        
        Although factoring is necessary to separate variables in some
        expressions, it is not necessary in all cases, so one should not
        count on the returned factors being factored.
