\section*{Abstract}

We combine the demographic detail of the Current Population Survey (CPS) with the tax precision of the IRS Public Use File (PUF) to create an enhanced microsimulation dataset. Our method uses quantile regression forests to transfer income and tax variables from the PUF to demographically-similar CPS households. We create a synthetic CPS-structured dataset using PUF tax information, stack it alongside the original CPS records, then use dropout-regularized gradient descent to reweight households toward administrative targets from IRS Statistics of Income, Census population estimates, and program participation data. This preserves the CPS's granular demographic and geographic information while leveraging the PUF's tax reporting accuracy. The enhanced dataset provides a foundation for analyzing federal tax policy, state tax systems, and benefit programs. We release both the enhanced dataset and our open-source enhancement procedure to support transparent policy analysis.
