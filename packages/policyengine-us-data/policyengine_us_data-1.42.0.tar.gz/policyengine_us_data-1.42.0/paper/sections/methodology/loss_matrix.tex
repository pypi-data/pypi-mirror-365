\subsection{Loss Matrix Construction}

The loss matrix measures deviation from 570 administrative targets sourced from IRS Statistics of Income (SOI), Census population estimates, CBO projections, and other administrative data.

\subsubsection{IRS Statistics of Income Targets}

For each combination of AGI bracket and filing status, we create targets for:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Adjusted gross income
    \item Count of returns
    \item Employment income
    \item Business net profits
    \item Capital gains (gross)
    \item Ordinary dividends
    \item Partnership and S-corporation income
    \item Qualified dividends 
    \item Taxable interest income
    \item Total pension income
    \item Total social security
\end{itemize}

For aggregate-level targets only, we track:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Business net losses
    \item Capital gains distributions
    \item Capital gains losses
    \item Estate income and losses
    \item Exempt interest
    \item IRA distributions
    \item Partnership and S-corporation losses
    \item Rent and royalty net income and losses
    \item Taxable pension income
    \item Taxable social security
    \item Unemployment compensation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Census Population Targets}

From Census population projections (np2023\_d5\_mid.csv), we include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Single-year age population counts from age 0 to 85
    \item Filtered to total population (SEX = 0, RACE\_HISP = 0)
    \item Projected to the target year
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{CBO Program Totals}

From CBO projections, we calibrate:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Income tax
    \item SNAP benefits
    \item Social security benefits
    \item SSI payments
    \item Unemployment compensation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{EITC Statistics}

From Treasury EITC data (eitc.csv), we target:
\begin{itemize}
    \item EITC recipient counts by number of qualifying children
    \item Total EITC amounts by number of qualifying children
\end{itemize}

The EITC values are uprated by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item EITC spending growth for amounts
    \item Population growth for recipient counts
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{CPS-Derived Statistics}

We calibrate to hardcoded totals for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Health insurance premiums without Medicare Part B: \$385B
    \item Other medical expenses: \$278B
    \item Medicare Part B premiums: \$112B
    \item Over-the-counter health expenses: \$72B
    \item SPM unit thresholds sum: \$3,945B
    \item Child support expense: \$33B
    \item Child support received: \$33B
    \item SPM unit capped work childcare expenses: \$348B
    \item SPM unit capped housing subsidy: \$35B
    \item TANF: \$9B
    \item Alimony income: \$13B
    \item Alimony expense: \$13B
    \item Real estate taxes: \$400B
    \item Rent: \$735B
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Market Income Targets}

From IRS SOI PUF estimates:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total negative household market income: -\$138B
    \item Count of households with negative market income: 3M
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Healthcare Spending by Age}

Using healthcare\_spending.csv, we target healthcare expenditures by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 10-year age groups
    \item Four expense categories:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Health insurance premiums without Medicare Part B
        \item Over-the-counter health expenses
        \item Other medical expenses
        \item Medicare Part B premiums
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{AGI by SPM Threshold}

From spm\_threshold\_agi.csv, we target:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Adjusted gross income totals by SPM threshold decile
    \item Count of households in each SPM threshold decile
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Target Validation}

The loss matrix construction enforces two key checks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item No missing values in any target row
    \item No NaN values in the targets array
\end{itemize}
