# LetsTry

A powerful single-file Python toolkit for Remote Code Execution (RCE) testing, file and directory enumeration, and Linux command execution.

> 🚨 For educational and authorized testing purposes only.

---

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ List files, folders, and recursively enumerate directories
- ✅ Run Linux commands and capture output
- ✅ Execute system-level calls
- ✅ Use `glob`, `pathlib`, and `os` modules together
- ✅ Optional socket callback support for RCE testing

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install letstry
````

---

## 🚀 Usage

```python
import letstry

# Run Linux command
print(letstry.run_command("uname -a"))

# List all files in /etc
print(letstry.list_files("/etc"))

# Recursive listing using pathlib
print(letstry.scan_pathlib("/var/log"))

# Run a command using os.system
letstry.run_os_system("ls -l")

# Send a callback to a listener
letstry.send_callback("192.168.1.100", 4444, "Ping from exploited box")

# Host information
print(letstry.get_host_info())
```
