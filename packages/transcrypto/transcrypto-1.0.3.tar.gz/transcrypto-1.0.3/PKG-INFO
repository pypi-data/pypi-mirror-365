```

and then `from transcrypto import transcrypto` for using it.

## Development Instructions

### Setup

If you want to develop for this project, first install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/), but make sure it is like this:

```sh
brew uninstall poetry
python3.11 -m pip install --user pipx
python3.11 -m pipx ensurepath
# re-open terminal
poetry self add poetry-plugin-export@^1.8  # allows export to requirements.txt (see below)
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true  # creates venv inside project directory
poetry config pypi-token.pypi <TOKEN>      # add you personal project token
```

Now install the project:

```sh
brew install python@3.13 git
brew update
brew upgrade
brew cleanup -s
# or on Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3.13-venv git

git clone https://github.com/balparda/transcrypto.git transcrypto
cd transcrypto

poetry env use python3.13  # creates the venv
poetry install --sync      # HONOR the project's poetry.lock file, uninstalls stray packages
poetry env info            # no-op: just to check

poetry run pytest -vvv
# or any command as:
poetry run <any-command>
```

To activate like a regular environment do:

```sh
poetry env activate
# will print activation command which you next execute, or you can do:
source .env/bin/activate                         # if .env is local to the project
source "$(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate"  # for other paths

pytest

deactivate
```

### Updating Dependencies

To update `poetry.lock` file to more current versions:

```sh
poetry update  # ignores current lock, updates, rewrites `poetry.lock` file
poetry run pytest
```

To add a new dependency you should:

```sh
poetry add "pkg>=1.2.3"  # regenerates lock, updates env
# also: "pkg@^1.2.3" = latest 1.* ; "pkg@~1.2.3" = latest 1.2.* ; "pkg@1.2.3" exact
poetry export --format requirements.txt --without-hashes --output requirements.txt
```

If you added a dependency to `pyproject.toml`:

```sh
poetry run pip3 freeze --all  # lists all dependencies pip knows about
poetry lock     # re-lock your dependencies, so `poetry.lock` is regenerated
poetry install  # sync your virtualenv to match the new lock file
poetry export --format requirements.txt --without-hashes --output requirements.txt
```

### Creating a New Version

```sh
# bump the version!
poetry version minor  # updates 1.6 to 1.7, for example
# or:
poetry version patch  # updates 1.6 to 1.6.1
# or:
poetry version <version-number>
# (also updates `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`)

# publish to GIT, including a TAG
git commit -a -m "release version 1.0.2"
git tag 1.0.2
git push
git push --tags

# prepare package for PyPI
poetry build
poetry publish
```
