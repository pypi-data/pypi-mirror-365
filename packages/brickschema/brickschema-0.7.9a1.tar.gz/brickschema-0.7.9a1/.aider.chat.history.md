To switch from Poetry to UV, you need to refactor your `pyproject.toml` to use the standard PEP 621 `[project]` table and `[build-system]` configuration. This involves:

1.  Migrating project metadata, dependencies, and script entry points from Poetry's specific `[tool.poetry]` format to `[project]` and `[project.optional-dependencies]`.
2.  Adjusting version specifiers to common PEP 440 formats (e.g., `~=` or `>=`).
3.  Updating the `[build-system]` to use `setuptools`, which is a common build backend compatible with UV.
4.  Removing Poetry-specific configurations like `include` and the path-based `pyontoenv` dependency, as these are handled differently with standard build tools and UV.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for `pyproject.toml`:

The `brickschema` package requires Python >= 3.8. It can be installed with `pip`:

```
pip install brickschema
```

The `brickschema` package offers several installation configuration options for reasoning.
The default bundled [OWLRL](https://pypi.org/project/owlrl/) reasoner delivers correct results, but exhibits poor performance on large or complex ontologies (we have observed minutes to hours) due to its bruteforce implementation.

The [Allegro reasoner](https://franz.com/agraph/support/documentation/current/materializer.html) has better performance and implements enough of the OWLRL profile to be useful. We execute Allegrograph in a Docker container, which requires the `docker` package. To install support for the Allegrograph reasoner, use

```
pip install brickschema[allegro]
```

The [reasonable Reasoner](https://github.com/gtfierro/reasonable) offers even better performance than the Allegro reasoner, but is currently only packaged for Linux and MacOS platforms. To install support for the reasonable Reasoner, use

```
pip install brickschema[reasonable]
```

Brick requires Python >= 3.6. We use [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically run code formatters and style checkers when you commit.

Use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to manage packaging and dependencies. After installing poetry, install dependencies with:

```bash
poetry install
```

Enter the development environment with the following command (this is analogous to activating a virtual environment.

```bash
poetry shell
```

On first setup, make sure to install the pre-commit hooks for running the formatting and linting tools:

```bash
# from within the environment; e.g. after running 'poetry shell'
pre-commit install
```

Run tests to make sure build is not broken

```bash
# from within the environment; e.g. after running 'poetry shell'
make test
```

#### update the github action to use uv instead of poetry  

To update the GitHub Action workflow to use uv instead of Poetry, I will modify `.github/workflows/builds.yml`.

The changes involve:
1.  Replacing the Poetry installation step with `astral-sh/setup-uv` for installing uv and setting up Python versions.
2.  Removing the separate `actions/setup-python` step as `setup-uv` handles Python installation.
3.  Updating the dependency installation commands from `poetry install` to `uv sync`.
4.  Updating the test command to use `uv run pytest`.
