Snipd export to a singal file sucks, which cannot query on obsidian, And I have more then 3,000 snipds on platform, If I format manully, it's would be a hell.

I export them and delete the account, even though the origin data is still on server. I have no idea how deal with that, or is there something alternative?

Any, snipd sucks!
