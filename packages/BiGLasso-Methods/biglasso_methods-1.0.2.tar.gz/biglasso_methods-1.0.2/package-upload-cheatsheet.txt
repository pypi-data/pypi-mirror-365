# PyPI

First, build the package:

```
python -m build
```

This should add files to `dist`, so run the following to put them on PyPI:

```
python3 -m twine upload dist/*
```

The username is __token__ and the password is the unique API token.

If we just want to test before uploading, `pip install .` will install the package from the local wheels
