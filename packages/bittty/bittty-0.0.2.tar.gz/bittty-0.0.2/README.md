# bittty

A pure Python terminal emulator.

Currently buggy and a bit slow, but it's still somewhat usable.

## Demo

Run the standalone demo:

```bash
python ./demo/terminal.py
```

Or use the textual demo to see it in a TUI:

```bash
uvx textual-tty
```

## todo / ideas

- [ ] split pty out into a cross platform package
- [x] break terminal project out from Textual deps
  - [x] write a minimal demo that doesn't need textual
  - [ ] gui
    - [ ] make `framebuffer.py`
    - [ ] choose a backend
- [ ] performance improvements
  - [ ] parse with regex over large buffer sizes
- [ ] scrollback buffer
  - [ ] implement `logloglog` for scrollback with wrapping
- [ ] bugs
  - [ ] blank background to end of line
  - [ ] corruption in stream - debug it
  - [ ] scroll region: scroll up in `vim` corrupts outside scroll region
- [ ] reduce redundancy redundancy of repeated repeated code code
  - [ ] code code of of redundancy redundancy
