# NordVPN WireGuard Configuration Generator

A command-line tool for generating optimized NordVPN WireGuard configurations.

## Project Philosophy: A Focus on Quality

This project has been fundamentally refocused. Previously, multiple versions existed across several programming languages. This approach divided development effort and resulted in inconsistent quality.

The new directive is singular: to provide one exceptionally engineered tool that is robust, maintainable, and correct.

To this end, all previous language implementations have been archived. Development is now concentrated on two platforms:

1.  **This Command-Line Tool:** A complete rewrite in Python, packaged for professional use.
2.  **A Web Interface:** For users who require a graphical frontend.

This consolidated effort ensures a higher standard of quality and a more reliable end-product.

## Core Capabilities

*   **Package Distribution:** The tool is a proper command-line application, installable via PyPI. This eliminates manual dependency management.
*   **Performance:** Asynchronous architecture processes the entire NordVPN server list in seconds.
*   **Optimization:** Intelligently sorts servers by current load and geographic proximity to the user, generating configurations for the most performant connections.
*   **Structured Output:** Automatically creates a clean directory structure containing standard configurations, a `best_configs` folder for optimal servers per location, and a `servers.json` file with detailed metadata for analysis.
*   **Interactive and Non-Interactive:** A guided TUI for interactive use. The core logic is structured to be scriptable.

## Installation

Prerequisites: Python 3.8+

Install the package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install nord-config-generator
```

## Usage

Execute the installed application:

```bash
nord-generator
```

The application will prompt for the required access token and configuration preferences.

## Web Version

A graphical alternative is available for direct use in a web browser.

*   **Current Version:** [https://nord-configs.selfhoster.nl/](https://nord-configs.selfhoster.nl/)
*   **Legacy Version:** [https://wg-nord.pages.dev/](https://wg-nord.pages.dev/)

## Support

Project visibility and continued development are supported by two actions:

1.  **Star the Repository:** Starring the project on GitHub increases its visibility.
2.  **NordVPN Referral:** Using the referral link for new subscriptions provides support at no additional cost. Link: [https://ref.nordvpn.com/MXIVDoJGpKT](https://ref.nordvpn.com/MXIVDoJGpKT)
