This module provides the ability to edit domains via the wizard,
allowing users to easily view and manage records. By doing so, it takes
full advantage of Odoo’s powerful search functionality, enhancing the
overall user experience and streamlining data management.

Usage
=====

In any view with a domain field widget and model, but we'll make the
example with a user filter:

1. Enter debug mode.
2. Go to the *Settings > Technical > User Interface > User-defined
   Filters*
3. Create a new one
4. Put a name to the filter and select a model (e.g.: Contact)
5. Click on the record selection button and a list dialog will be
   opened. There you can either:

..

   - Select individual records: those ids will be added to the domain.
   - Set filters that will be applied to the domain and select all the
     records to add it as a new filter.
   - Set groups that will be converted into search filters, select all
     the records and those unfolded groups will be set as filters to.

You can still edit the filter with Odoo's widget after that.
