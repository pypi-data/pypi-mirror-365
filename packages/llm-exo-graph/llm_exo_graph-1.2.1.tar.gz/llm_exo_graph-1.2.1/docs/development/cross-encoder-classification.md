# Cross-Encoder and Hybrid Classification for Knowledge Graph

## Overview

The Knowledge Graph Engine v2.2.0 introduces **cross-encoder** support and a **hybrid two-stage approach** for improved relationship classification. The hybrid approach combines the speed of bi-encoders with the accuracy of cross-encoders for optimal performance.

## Why Cross-Encoders?

### Bi-Encoder vs Cross-Encoder

**Bi-Encoders** (like the existing sentence transformers):
- Encode texts independently into fixed vectors
- Compare using cosine similarity
- Fast but less accurate for nuanced semantic matching
- Good for retrieval and initial filtering

**Cross-Encoders**:
- Process both texts together in a single forward pass
- Model the full interaction between texts
- More computationally expensive but significantly more accurate
- Ideal for re-ranking and final classification

### Benefits for Knowledge Graph

1. **Better Relationship Standardization**: More accurately maps similar relationships (e.g., "works at", "is employed by", "has a job at") to the same standardized edge type
2. **Improved Category Detection**: Better understanding of semantic categories for relationships
3. **Reduced Duplicates**: Fewer duplicate edges due to better matching
4. **Context-Aware Matching**: Understands nuanced differences in meaning

## Implementation

### Architecture

The cross-encoder functionality is integrated into the `ClassifierDetector` class with hybrid support:

```python
class ClassifierDetector:
    def __init__(self, classifier_map: ClassifierMap, embedder=None, 
                 use_cross_encoder: bool = True, use_hybrid: bool = True, top_k: int = 10):
        # Hybrid approach is enabled by default when both encoders are available
        self.use_hybrid = use_hybrid and use_cross_encoder and embedder is not None
```

### Classification Approaches

#### 1. **Hybrid Approach (Default)**
The hybrid two-stage approach provides the best balance of speed and accuracy:

**Stage 1: Bi-Encoder Retrieval**
- Uses bi-encoder to quickly retrieve top-k candidates
- Fast vector similarity search (5-10ms)
- Casts a wide net to ensure good candidates

**Stage 2: Cross-Encoder Reranking**
- Reranks only the top-k candidates with cross-encoder
- More accurate scoring of semantic similarity
- Final selection based on refined scores

#### 2. **Cross-Encoder Only**
- Processes all candidates with cross-encoder
- Most accurate but slowest approach
- Good for small datasets or when accuracy is critical

#### 3. **Bi-Encoder Only**
- Uses only vector similarity
- Fastest approach but less accurate
- Good for real-time applications with strict latency requirements

### Classification Flow

1. **Check Existing Mappings**: First checks if the relationship already exists in the classifier map
2. **Hybrid Detection** (if enabled):
   - Stage 1: Bi-encoder retrieves top-k candidates
   - Stage 2: Cross-encoder reranks and selects best match
3. **Cross-Encoder Only** (if hybrid disabled):
   - Direct cross-encoder scoring of all candidates
4. **Bi-Encoder Only** (if cross-encoder disabled):
   - Vector similarity matching
5. **Word-Based Matching**: Final fallback for basic similarity

### Thresholds

- **Category Detection**: 0.7 (70%) - Balance between accuracy and coverage
- **Edge Matching**: 0.85 (85%) - High threshold to ensure only very similar edges are merged

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Models are now initialized externally and passed as parameters:

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, CrossEncoder
from exo_graph.utils.graph_standardizer import GraphStandardizer
from exo_graph.models.classifier_map import ClassifierMap

# Initialize models externally
embedder = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
cross_encoder = CrossEncoder('cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2')

# Hybrid approach (recommended)
detector = GraphStandardizer(
    classifier_map,
    embedder,
    cross_encoder=cross_encoder,
    use_hybrid=True,
    top_k=10  # Number of candidates for reranking
)
```

### Different Configurations

```python
# Initialize models once
embedder = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
cross_encoder = CrossEncoder('cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2')

# Hybrid approach (recommended)
detector_hybrid = ClassifierDetector(
    classifier_map, embedder, 
    cross_encoder=cross_encoder, 
    use_hybrid=True
)

# Cross-encoder only (most accurate, slowest)
detector_ce = ClassifierDetector(
    classifier_map, embedder, 
    cross_encoder=cross_encoder, 
    use_hybrid=False
)

# Bi-encoder only (fastest, less accurate)
detector_be = ClassifierDetector(classifier_map, embedder)  # No cross-encoder

# Check active method
method = detector.get_similarity_method()
# Returns: "hybrid (bi-encoder top-10 + cross-encoder)", "cross-encoder", "bi-encoder"
```

### Tuning Top-K Parameter

The `top_k` parameter controls how many candidates the bi-encoder retrieves for cross-encoder reranking:

```python
# Faster but may miss some matches
detector_fast = ClassifierDetector(
    classifier_map, embedder, 
    cross_encoder=cross_encoder, 
    top_k=5
)

# Default balanced approach
detector_balanced = ClassifierDetector(
    classifier_map, embedder, 
    cross_encoder=cross_encoder, 
    top_k=10
)

# More thorough but slower
detector_thorough = ClassifierDetector(
    classifier_map, embedder, 
    cross_encoder=cross_encoder, 
    top_k=20
)
```

### Error Handling

Handle model initialization failures appropriately:

```python
try:
    embedder = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to initialize embedder: {e}")
    raise  # Embedder is mandatory

try:
    cross_encoder = CrossEncoder('cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2')
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Cross-encoder unavailable: {e}")
    cross_encoder = None

# Use bi-encoder only if cross-encoder fails
detector = ClassifierDetector(classifier_map, embedder, cross_encoder=cross_encoder)
```

## Examples

### Employment Relationships

Input variations:
- "Alice is employed by Microsoft"
- "Bob works at Google"
- "Charlie has a job at Apple"

All map to standardized: `WORKS_AT` or `IS_EMPLOYED_BY`

### Geographic Relationships

Input variations:
- "Paris is located in France"
- "Tokyo is in Japan"
- "Berlin is situated in Germany"

All map to standardized: `LOCATED_IN`

### Activity Relationships

Input variations:
- "Alice enjoys photography"
- "Bob has a hobby of hiking"
- "Charlie is interested in painting"

Map to appropriate standardized forms like `HAS_HOBBY` or `ENJOYS`

## Performance Considerations

### Speed vs Accuracy Trade-off

Based on benchmarks with typical workloads:

| Approach | Speed (per item) | Accuracy | Use Case |
|----------|-----------------|----------|----------|
| **Hybrid (top-10)** | ~15-25ms | High | **Recommended default** |
| Hybrid (top-5) | ~10-15ms | Good | Speed-critical with good accuracy |
| Hybrid (top-20) | ~25-35ms | Highest | Maximum accuracy needed |
| Cross-Encoder Only | ~50-100ms | Highest | Small datasets, critical accuracy |
| Bi-Encoder Only | ~5-10ms | Moderate | Real-time, latency-critical |
| Word-Based | ~1ms | Low | Fallback only |

### Performance Benefits of Hybrid Approach

The hybrid approach typically provides:
- **2-4x speedup** over cross-encoder only
- **95%+ of the accuracy** of cross-encoder only
- **Scalable** to large numbers of categories and edges

### Recommendations

1. **Use Hybrid Approach (Default) for**:
   - Most production workloads
   - Balancing speed and accuracy
   - Large-scale classification tasks

2. **Adjust top-k based on needs**:
   - `top_k=5`: Speed-critical applications
   - `top_k=10`: Balanced performance (default)
   - `top_k=20`: Maximum accuracy requirements

3. **Use Cross-Encoder Only for**:
   - Small datasets (<100 categories/edges)
   - Critical classification accuracy
   - One-time standardization tasks

4. **Use Bi-Encoder Only for**:
   - Real-time processing (<10ms latency requirement)
   - Initial prototyping
   - Systems without cross-encoder support

## Model Selection

The implementation uses `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`:
- Lightweight (22M parameters)
- Good balance of speed and accuracy
- Trained on semantic similarity tasks

Alternative models for different use cases:
- `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2`: More accurate, slower
- `cross-encoder/ms-marco-TinyBERT-L-2-v2`: Faster, less accurate
- `cross-encoder/stsb-roberta-large`: Best accuracy, slowest

## Future Enhancements

1. **Caching**: Cache cross-encoder results for common relationship pairs
2. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple relationships in batches for efficiency
3. **Custom Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune cross-encoder on domain-specific relationship data
4. **Confidence Scores**: Expose confidence scores in the API for downstream processing
5. **Multi-lingual Support**: Add cross-encoder models for other languages

## Troubleshooting

### Cross-Encoder Not Loading

If you see: "Failed to initialize cross-encoder: [error]. Falling back to bi-encoder."

Solutions:
1. Install sentence-transformers: `pip install sentence-transformers>=2.2.0`
2. Check internet connection (model downloads on first use)
3. Manually download model: `CrossEncoder('cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2')`

### Performance Issues

If classification is too slow:
1. Disable cross-encoder: `use_cross_encoder=False`
2. Use a smaller model
3. Implement caching for repeated relationships
4. Process in batches

### Accuracy Issues

If relationships aren't being standardized well:
1. Check threshold values (may need adjustment for your domain)
2. Ensure embedder is also initialized for fallback
3. Review classifier map categories
4. Consider fine-tuning the cross-encoder model
