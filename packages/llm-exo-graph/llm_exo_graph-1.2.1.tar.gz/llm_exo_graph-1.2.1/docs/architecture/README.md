## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### 1. **Neo4j-First Design**
- Native Neo4j integration for all graph operations
- Leverages Neo4j's ACID properties and performance
- Uses Cypher queries for complex graph traversals

### 2. **Hybrid Storage Architecture**
- Graph data stored in Neo4j for relationships and structure
- Vector embeddings stored in Neo4j vector indexes for semantic search
- Unified query interface combining graph and vector operations

### 3. **Modular Component Design**
- Clear separation of concerns between components
- Pluggable architecture for easy extensions
- Interface-based design for testability

### 4. **Performance-Optimized**
- Efficient query patterns and indexing strategies
- Batch operations for bulk data processing
- Caching and optimization at multiple layers

### 5. **Production-Ready**
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Configuration management for different environments
- Monitoring and observability built-in
