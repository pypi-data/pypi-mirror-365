# About:

CellDiffusion(Single-Cell graph neural Diffusion) is a deep diffusion model to leverage multi-scale patterns in single-cell graphs and enhance scRNA-seq analysis. Single-cell transcriptomics are typically analyzed based on gene expression within individual cells and hypothetic cell adjacencies. However, existing computational methods often suffer from a lack of leveraging and integrating multi-scale dependencies in feature space, undermining their effectiveness and robustness in downstream applications like handling of batch effects, cell type identification, and cell fate inference. To tackle this challenge, we introduce CellDiffusion to incorporate long-range information propagation among cells to uncover cellular biology from their transcriptomics. CellDiffusion integrates both local and global diffusion processes to comprehensively capture cell relationships, ranging from fine-grained structures to large-scale patterns. This approach exhibits great perception of inherent cell types and potential lineages and preserves cell identities in batch-imbalanced datasets. CellDiffusion enhances various downstream tasks, including data integration, reference-based cell type annotation, unsupervised clustering, and trajectory inference.
