# elpie

elpie is a minimalist Emacs-style command-line text editor written in
Python, developed by AI (Microsoft Copilot) and product architect
Francis Peck. It leverages only the standard library (curses,
dataclasses) to deliver a familiar editing experience without external
dependencies.

## Features

- Emacs-style keybindings for navigation and editing  
- Kill-ring support with `Ctrl-k` (kill-line) and `Ctrl-y` (yank)  
- Auto-save via `Ctrl-s` and graceful exit with `Ctrl-x` `Ctrl-c`  
- Zero external dependencies; runs on Python 3.8+  
- Easy pip installation and console-script usage  

## Installation


    # From your project directory (with pyproject.toml present)
    pip install .

or ...

    pip install elpie

## Usage

    elpie [path/to/file.txt]

Providing a filename opens (or creates) that file. Omitting the argument opens an empty buffer.
