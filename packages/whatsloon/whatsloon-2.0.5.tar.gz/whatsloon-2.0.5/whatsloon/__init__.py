    Main client for WhatsApp Cloud API.

    - Use this class directly for all WhatsApp features:
        >>> from whatsloon import WhatsAppCloudAPIClient
        >>> client = WhatsAppCloudAPIClient(...)
        >>> client.send_text_message("Hello!")

    - Or compose your own client with only the mixins you need:
        >>> from whatsloon import WhatsAppBaseClient, TextSender, ImageSender
        >>> class MyClient(WhatsAppBaseClient, TextSender, ImageSender):
        ...     pass
        >>> client = MyClient(...)
        >>> client.send_text_message("Hi!")

    All mixins are available for import from the package root.
