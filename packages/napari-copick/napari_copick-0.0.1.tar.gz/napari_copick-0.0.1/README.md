A plugin for collaborative annotation in cryoET using copick

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html
-->

## Installation

You can install `napari-copick` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-copick

To install latest development version:

    pip install git+https://github.com/kephale/napari-copick.git

## Usage

### Using a copick config file

```bash
python -m napari_copick.widget --config_path path/to/copick_config.json
```

### Using dataset IDs from CZ cryoET Data Portal

```bash
python -m napari_copick.widget --dataset_ids 10440 10441 --overlay_root /path/to/overlay_root
```

You can specify multiple dataset IDs separated by spaces.

### GUI Usage

The plugin provides an intuitive interface with two loading options:

1. **Load Config File**: Opens a file dialog to select a copick configuration JSON file
2. **Load from Dataset IDs**: Opens a dialog to enter CZ cryoET Data Portal dataset IDs and overlay root path

After loading, you'll see a hierarchical tree of the project structure that you can navigate to access tomograms, segmentations, and picks.

### Tomogram Handling

napari-copick now handles multiscale zarr arrays directly:

- Automatically detects and loads all available resolution levels
- Creates a proper multiscale image stack using napari's native multiscale API
- Uses dask for efficient lazy loading of large tomogram data
- Applies appropriate scaling factors based on the voxel size metadata

This direct zarr handling provides better performance and more flexibility compared to relying on external plugins.
