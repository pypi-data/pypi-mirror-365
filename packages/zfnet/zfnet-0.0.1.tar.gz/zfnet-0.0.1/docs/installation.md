# Installation

## Stable release

To install zfnet, run this command in your terminal:

```sh
pip install zfnet
```

This is the preferred method to install zfnet, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this [Python installation guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/) can guide you through the process.

## From sources

Or download the [tarball](https://github.com/pnm4sfix/zfnet/tarball/master):

```sh
curl -OJL https://github.com/pnm4sfix/zfnet/tarball/master
