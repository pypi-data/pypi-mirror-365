Welcome to Juhamâ„¢ - Juha's Ultimate Home Automation Core
========================================================

Description
-----------

``juham-core`` extends the functionality of ``Masterpiece`` object by adding capabilities for MQTT
communication and integration with time series databases. The base class provides only a minimal
set of interfaces. Actual features, such as MQTT and time series database implementations â€” along with home
automation-specific functionalities â€” are provided through separate plugin modules built on ``juham-core`` class.


Project Status and Goals
------------------------

**Current State**: **Pre-Alpha (Status 2)**  

The aim of Juhamâ„¢ is to have fun by learning Python and GitLab ecosystems, by developing a home automation
framework capable of controlling all the devices in my home, with the potential to be adapted for other homes as well.

In its current form, Juhamâ„¢ may still resemble more of an experiment (or even a "mess") than a "masterpiece,"
but Iâ€™m working hard to turn it into one!



Special Thanks
--------------

This project would not have been possible without the generous support of two exceptional individuals: Teppo K. and Mahi.

Teppo K. provided the initial spark for this project by donating a Raspberry Pi, a temperature sensor, and giving an inspiring
demonstration of his own home automation systemâ€”effectively dragging me down the rabbit hole of endless tinkering.

Mahi has been instrumental in translating my half-baked ideas into Python code, offering invaluable support and
encouragementâ€”while also ensuring that every time I thought I was done, I wasnâ€™t.

Because of these two gentlemen, my already minimal spare time dropped into the negatives as I desperately tried to push the
system to some semblance of professionalism.

Iâ€™m truly grateful to bothâ€”really. ðŸ˜…
