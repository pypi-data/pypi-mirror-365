# Pact Python FFI

> [!NOTE]
>
> This package provides direct access to the Pact Foreign Function Interface (FFI) with minimal abstraction. It is intended for advanced users who need low-level control over Pact operations in Python.

---

This sub-package is part of the [Pact Python](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-python) project and exists to expose the [Pact FFI](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-reference) directly to Python. If you are looking for the main Pact Python library for contract testing, please see the [root package](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-python#pact-python).

## Overview

-   The module provides a thin Python wrapper around the Pact FFI (C API).
-   Most classes correspond directly to structs from the FFI, and are designed to wrap the underlying C pointers.
-   Many classes implement the `__del__` method to ensure memory allocated by the Rust library is freed when the Python object is destroyed, preventing memory leaks.
-   Functions from the FFI are exposed directly: if a function `foo` exists in the FFI, it is accessible as `pact_ffi.foo(...)`.
-   The API is not guaranteed to be stable and is intended for use by advanced users or for building higher-level libraries. For typical contract testing, use the main Pact Python client library.

## Installation

You can install this package via pip:

```console
pip install pact-python-ffi
```

## Usage

This package exposes the raw FFI bindings for Pact. It is suitable for advanced use cases, custom integrations, or for building higher-level libraries. For typical contract testing, prefer using the main Pact Python library.

## Contributing

As this is a relatively thin wrapper around the Pact FFI, the code is unlikely to change frequently; however, contributions to improve the coverage of the FFI bindings or to improve existing functionality are welcome. See the [main contributing guide](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

To release a new version of `pact-python-ffi`, simply push a tag in the format `pact-python-ffi/x.y.z.w`. This will automatically trigger a release process, pulling in version `x.y.z` of the underlying Pact FFI. Before creating and pushing such a tag, please ensure that the Python wrapper has been updated to reflect any changes or updates in the corresponding FFI version.

Higher-level abstractions or utilities should be implemented in separate libraries (such as [`pact-python`](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-python)).
