"""
Asynchronous Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Example

This example demonstrates true asynchronous HITL workflows where:
1. Agent execution can be suspended for external approval
2. The process doesn't block waiting for approval
3. Execution can be resumed hours or days later
4. Multiple suspended executions can be managed concurrently

This solves the real-world problem where waiting for human approval
would otherwise block the entire application process.
