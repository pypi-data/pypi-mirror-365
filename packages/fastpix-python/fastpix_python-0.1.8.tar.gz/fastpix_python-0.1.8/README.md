Below is an example of configuring `FastPix Python SDK` into your project.

`Note:-` For Async SDK Users: When using the AsyncClient, all SDK methods must be prefixed with the await keyword.
```python
# Sync Usage
from fastpix.client import Client

client = Client(username="your-access-token-id", password="your-secret-key")

# Define the parameters for fetching media assets in a separate variable.
media_request_params = {
    "limit": 10,  # Number of media assets to fetch in one request.
    "offset": 1,  # Starting position for the list of media assets (useful for pagination).
    "orderBy": "desc"  # Sort order for the media assets ("desc" for descending, "asc" for ascending).
}

try:
   media = client.media.get_all_media(params=media_request_params)
   print("Media:", media)
except Exception as e:
   print(f"Error fetching media: {str(e)}")

# Async Usage 
from fastpix import AsyncClient as Client
import asyncio
 
async def main():
    # Initialize the AsyncClient with username and password.
    client = Client(username="your-access-token-id", password="your-secret-key")
 
    # Define the parameters for fetching media assets in a separate variable.
    media_request_params = {
        "limit": 10,  # Number of media assets to fetch in one request.
        "offset": 1,  # Starting position for the list of media assets (useful for pagination).
        "orderBy": "desc"  # Sort order for the media assets ("desc" for descending, "asc" for ascending).
    }
 
    try:
        # Fetch media assets asynchronously using the await keyword.
        media = await client.media.get_all_media(params=media_request_params)
        print("Media:", media)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching media: {str(e)}")
 
# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Usage:

### 1. Media Operations:
