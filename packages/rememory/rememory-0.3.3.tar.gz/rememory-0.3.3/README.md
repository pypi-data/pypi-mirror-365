# Rememory

Rememory provides **shared-memory data structures** (`RememoryDict` and `RememoryList`) as well as basic types (`str`, `int`, `float`, and `bool`) that work safely across multiple processes – even across completely independent Python interpreters – using OS-level named locks.

This is designed for scenarios where you need a simple, Python-native way to share structured state between processes without relying on an external database or message broker. Data is serialized in shared memory using Python's pickle format.

## Features

* **Shared-memory backend** using `multiprocessing.shared_memory`
* **Cross-process synchronization** with OS-level locks (Windows mutex / POSIX semaphore)
* Works across separate scripts and interpreters, not just `multiprocessing.Process`
* Drop-in replacements for `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `Dict` and `List`
* Type-safe generics for editors and type checkers (e.g. `RememoryDict[str, int]`)


## Installation

```bash
pip install rememory
```

## Dependencies

On **Linux/macOS** `posix_ipc`, on **Windows** `pywin32`:


## Basic Usage

### RememoryDict

```python
from rememory import Dict # RMDict, or RememoryDict also work

# Create or attach to a shared dict
shared: Dict[str, dict[str, int]] = Dict("game_state")

# Write to it (any process using the same name sees these changes)
shared["player1"] = {"score": 10, "level": 2}

# Read from it
print(shared["player1"])

# Iterate
for key, value in shared.items():
    print(key, value)
```

Any process that does `Dict("game_state")` will connect to the same shared memory block.

### RememoryList

```python
from rememory import List # RMList, or RememoryList also work

shared_list: List[str] = List("chat")

# Append items
shared_list.append("hello")
shared_list.append("world")

# Read
print(shared_list[0])  # "hello"
for item in shared_list:
    print(item)
```
### RememoryInt
```python
from rememory import int, IntTypes # RMInt, or RememoryInt also work

counter = int("shared_counter", IntTypes.INT32)

counter.value = 42

print(counter.value)  # 42
```
### RememoryFloat
```python
from rememory import float, FloatTypes # RMFloat, or RememoryFloat also work

pi = float("pi", FloatTypes.FLOAT32)

pi.value = 3.14

print(pi.value)
```
### RememoryBlock
```python
from noexcept import NoBaseException
from rememory import Block, BlockSize

# Store arbitrary pickleable objects in shared memory
class CustomError:
    pass

err_block: Block[CustomError] = Block("err_block", BlockSize.s256)

err_block.value = CustomError("boom")

print(err_block.value)
```
### RememoryString
```python
from rememory import str, BlockSize # RMString, or RememoryString also work

msg = str("message", BlockSize.S128)

msg.value = "Hello"

print(msg.value)
```
### RememoryBool
```python
from rememory import bool

flag = bool("ready")

flag.value = True

print(flag.value)
```

## Multiprocessing Example

```python
from multiprocessing import Process
from rememory import Dict, List

SHARED_DICT = "game"
SHARED_LIST = "events"

def worker():
    d = Dict[str, dict[str, int]](SHARED_DICT)
    pid = str(os.getpid())
    d[pid] = {"score": 1, "level": 1}
    d[pid]["score"] += 1

    l = List[str](SHARED_LIST)
    l.append(f"{pid}-joined")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    d = Dict[str, dict[str, int]](SHARED_DICT)
    l = List[str](SHARED_LIST)

    # Clear previous state
    d._write_data({})
    l._write_data([])

    procs = [Process(target=worker) for _ in range(4)]
    for p in procs: p.start()
    for p in procs: p.join()

    print("Shared dict:", dict(d.items()))
    print("Shared list:", list(l))
```

## Locking

Rememory uses **OS-named synchronization primitives**:

* **Windows:** Named mutex via `pywin32`
* **Linux/macOS:** POSIX named semaphore via `posix_ipc`

This ensures that even **separate Python scripts** respect locking when using the same shared memory name.

## When to Use

* Game engines or simulations needing shared state between processes
* Multi-process pipelines without a heavy DB or broker
* Debugging tools that need live shared state

## When Not to Use

* When your data doesn’t fit in memory
* When you need persistence beyond process lifetime (shared memory is volatile)
