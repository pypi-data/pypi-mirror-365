Enhanced Mood Tracking
======================

The Enhanced Mood Tracking system provides advanced mood analytics, comprehensive mood vocabulary, and sophisticated pattern recognition to give you deeper insights into your emotional wellbeing.

* **Advanced pattern recognition** across time periods
* **Trend analysis** showing emotional trajectory
