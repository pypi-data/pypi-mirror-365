Mood Tracking
=============

Comprehensive mood tracking is the foundation of mental health awareness. om provides sophisticated tools for monitoring, analyzing, and understanding your emotional patterns.

üéØ Overview
===========

om's mood tracking system goes beyond simple "good" or "bad" ratings. It captures:

- **Multi-dimensional emotions** (mood, energy, stress, anxiety)
- **Contextual information** (triggers, location, activities)
- **Pattern recognition** (trends, cycles, correlations)
- **Predictive insights** (early warning systems)
- **Tag-based organization** (flexible categorization)

Quick Mood Check
================

The fastest way to log your mood:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Quick mood check (10 seconds)
   om qm

This prompts for:

1. **Mood rating** (1-10 scale)
2. **Optional notes** (context, triggers, thoughts)
3. **Follow-up suggestions** (based on your rating)

**Example interaction:**

.. code-block:: text

   üìä Quick Mood Check
   How are you feeling right now? (1-10): 7
   Any notes about your mood? (optional): Feeling productive after morning coffee
   
   ‚úÖ Mood logged! (7/10)
   üí° Suggestion: Since you're feeling good, this might be a great time for a gratitude practice.
   
   Try: om qg

Enhanced Mood Tracking
======================

For deeper emotional awareness:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Comprehensive mood entry

   # Enhanced mood tracking with full details

- **Intensity ratings** for multiple dimensions
- **Trigger identification** (work, relationships, health, etc.)
