# K8S-Debugger: Diagnose-Your-K8S-Environment
K8S-Debugger is a Kubernetes Diagnosing tool, which helps developers debug what's wrong with their cluster, This will save developers time, as they don't have to deep dive into Logs and try to understand as K8S-Debugger does it for you 

## Version 0.0.1 Features 

1) **Pod Debugging** : The V1 is a start of the project, and this is only going to debug the pod based issues, although there are multiple pod based issues that can occur in a kubernetes cluster, but Apparently most frequent and most occuring errors have been included in this iteration 

2) **AI Feature** : Some Pod based errors in K8S cluster might not be detected by the tool. In that case i would highly encourage you to use --explain feature, ensure to setup GROQ_API_KEY before using the --explain feature
