## üîç Advanced Usage

### Creating a GitHub Token

For better API rate limits, create a GitHub Personal Access Token:

1. Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer Settings ‚Üí Personal Access Tokens ‚Üí Fine-grained tokens
2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Give it a name and set expiration
4. Select "Only select repositories" and choose repositories you want to analyze
5. For permissions, grant "Read-only" access to "Issues" and "Pull requests"
6. Click "Generate token" and copy it

### Using in a Project

```python
import os
from github_oss_contributions import GitHubOssContributions

# Use environment variables for sensitive tokens
token = os.environ.get("GITHUB_TOKEN")
client = GitHubOssContributions(username="your_github_username", token=token)
contributions = client.get_contributions()

# Process the contributions
total_orgs = len(contributions)
total_issues = sum(len(data['issues']) for data in contributions.values())
total_prs = sum(len(data['prs']) for data in contributions.values())

print(f"Contributed to {total_orgs} organizations")
print(f"Created {total_issues} issues and {total_prs} pull requests")
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### API Rate Limits

If you encounter rate limiting errors:

1. Use a GitHub personal access token
2. Make fewer requests in a short time period
3. Check your rate limit status: `https://api.github.com/rate_limit`

### Common Issues

- **Authentication Errors**: Verify your token has required permissions
- **No Results**: Confirm the username is correct and has public activity
- **Connection Issues**: Check your network connection
