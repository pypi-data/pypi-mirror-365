# MVP Build Plan

## Application Type
A web application backend that uses an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture.

## Core Purpose
To provide a flexible and extensible data model for a web application, likely a blog or forum, using an ECS pattern.

## Key Technologies
- Python
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- SQLite

## Core Features
- **Entity Management**: Create, read, update, and delete entities.
- **Component Management**: Create, read, update, and delete components.
- **Entity-Component Mapping**: Associate components with entities.
- **Database Initialization**: Set up the database schema and initial data.
- **Web API**: Expose the ECS functionality through a RESTful API.

## Visual Design and UX
This is a backend application, so there is no visual design or UX component at this stage.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from version control.
- [x] **Finalize Database Schema**: The `schema.py` file is the single source of truth for the database schema.
2.  **Implement CRUD Operations**: Complete the CRUD operations in `crud.py` for all tables.
3.  **Develop REST API**: Create a Flask-based REST API to expose the CRUD operations.
4.  **Write Unit Tests**: Implement unit tests for the CRUD operations and API endpoints.
5.  **Create Documentation**: Document the API endpoints and the ECS architecture.
