# Python wrapper Library for Pickering LXI ClientBridge driver #

Python wrapper Library for Pickering LXI ClientBridge driver. It supports both Python 2.x and 3.x.
For PIFGLX functionality a C++ ClientBridge >= 1.80.0 is needed.

----------
# Installation Instructions #

We provide both a python module that can be installed to the system using `pip` and can be added manually to a project by copying a file into the directory that you are working in. For either installation method please make sure that you have installed ClientBridge. If you intend to use ClientBridge with PXI please make sure you also install Pickering PXI Installer Package. These can be found at the following addresses:

 - [PXI Installer Package](https://pickeringtest.info/downloads/drivers/PXI_Drivers/)
 - [ClientBridge Driver](https://pickeringtest.info/downloads/drivers/Sys60/)

**Please note that there is an additional dependency 'enum34' for Python 2.x and Python 3.x versions < 3.4. This package must be installed manually prior to using the wrapper with older versions of Python.**

----------
## Install Using `pip` ##

To install Python Pilxi from our download site using pip - open a command line prompt and navigate to the directory the library has been extracted to. From there enter the following command:
```
pip install .
```

----------
## Install Manually ##

To install Python Pilxi manually please copy pilxi directory containing `__init__.py` to your project. 

----------
# Using Pilxi #

Pilxi can be used to control our 40/50/60 series pickering products.

## Open a session with LXI ## 

In order to query an LXI unit and open/operate cards, you must first open a session. This can be done by passing an IP address to the `pilxi.Pi_Session` constructor. To use local PXI cards, pass "PXI" in place of the IP address.
```python 
import pilxi

IP_Address = "192.168.1.1"

try:
    session = pilxi.Pi_Session(IP_Address)

except pilxi.Error as ex:
    print("Error occurred opening LXI session:", ex.message)
```

## List cards ##

To get a list of the available cards IDs use `GetUsableCards()`. This will return a list of card IDs. To list the bus and slot number for all of the cards use `FindFreeCards()`, which takes in the total card count. Please see below for worked examples on how to use both of these functions:

```python
import pilxi

# Connect to chassis
IP_Address = '192.168.1.1'

# Port, timeout parameters are optional, defaults will be used otherwise.
session = pilxi.Pi_Session(IP_Address)
# or 
session = pilxi.Pi_Session(IP_Address, port=1024, timeout=5000)

# Get list of Card IDs for cards in chassis
cardID_array = session.GetUsableCards(0)
print("Card IDs:", cardID_array)


# Get list of Card Bus and Device Numbers
card_array = session.FindFreeCards()

for card in card_array:
    bus, device = card
    print("Card at bus {} device {}".format(bus, device))
```

## Open Card ##

There are three ways to open a card:
 - Using the Bus and Device number
 - Using the Card ID and Access mode
 - Using an alias specified using Resource Manager

To open a card at a specific bus and device location, use `Pi_Session.OpenCard(bus, device)`. When opening a card with Bus and Slot number only one program can access the card at a time, which means that you cannot have another program monitor the card. To do that the card needs to be opened with the Card ID and specifying the Access mode to allow multiple programs at once. The Card ID can be obtained from the list of cards show in the earlier example. Please see below for a worked example on how to use `pi_card` in either way:

```python
# Open a card by bus and device:
import pilxi

card = session.OpenCard(bus, device)

# accessType parameter is optional, default value is 1 (shared access)
# see pilxi.AccessTypes enum for options
card = session.OpenCardByID(cardID, accessType=pilxi.AccessTypes.MULTIUSER)

# Cards can be closed explicitly, garbage collection will close cards and sessions otherwise
card.Close()
```

Aliases must be specified in the Resource Manager application. From there you can save a copy of the resource file locally which can be copied into your project directory for easy access. You can then open a card by alias using the `pilxi.Pi_Card_ByAlias` class:

```python
rsrcfile = "LocalResources.rml"
alias = "my_alias"

# Resource file, access type and timeout parameters are optional. 
card = pilxi.Pi_Card_ByAlias(alias, rsrcfile, accessType=1, timeout=5000)

card.Close()
```

## Operate Switching cards ##

There are three main types of switching cards:
    - Switches
    - Multiplexer
    - Matrix

To operate Switches and Multiplexers use `OpBit()` providing subunit, switch point, and switch state. Matrices can be controller using `OpCrosspoint()` which requires the subunit, row, column, and switch state. Please see below for worked examples on using these functions:

```python
# Control Switches and Multiplexer cards
subunit = 1
switchpoint = 1

state = True
card.OpBit(subunit, switchpoint, state)
    
state = False
card.OpBit(subunit, switchpoint, state)


# Control Matrix cards
row = 1
column = 1
card.OpCrosspoint(subunit, row, column, True)

card.OpCrosspoint(subunit, row, column, False)


# Set a range of crosspoints on a given row 
start = 1
end = 8
card.SetCrosspointRange(subunit, row, start, end, 1)
```

### Using Subunit States ### 

The Python-Pilxi wrapper contains methods to read entire subunit states, e.g. the current switch configuration of a switching or matrix card, manipulate these states and apply the state back to the card in one single operation. This means, for example, multiple crosspoints can be connected at once, or the user may have multiple desired matrix/switch states and alternate between them. 

Example for manipulating matrix card states:
```python
# Get an object representing the current state of the specified matrix subunit:
subState = card.GetSubState(subunit)

# Set matrix crosspoints 1, 1 and 2, 2 on the subunit state;
# No actual switching occurs yet.
subState.PreSetCrosspoint(1, 1, True)
subState.PreSetCrosspoint(2, 2, True)

# Apply the subunit state.
# Crosspoints changed will now be applied to the physical card. 
card.WriteSubState(subunit, subState)
```
Example for manipulating switching card states:
```python
# Get an object representing the current state of the specified switch subunit:
subState = card.GetSubState(subunit)

# Set switches 1 and 2 on the subunit state;
# No actual switching occurs yet.
subState.PreSetBit(1, True)
subState.PreSetBit(2, True)

# Apply the subunit state.
# Switches changed will now be applied to the physical card. 
card.WriteSubState(subunit, subState)
```
It is also possible to obtain a subunit state object representing a clear subunit:
```python
blankSubunitState = card.GetBlankSubState(subunit)
```

## Operate Resistor Cards ##

Resistor cards come in two varieties: Programmable Resitor, and Presision Resistor. Programmable Resistors are controlled like Switch Cards shown above. Presision Resistor Cards have specific resistor functions. To set a resistance `ResSetResistance` is used and to get the current resistance `ResGetResistance` is used as shown below:

```python
# Set Resistance of given subunit, resistance value in Ohms
mode = 0
resistance = 330.0

card.ResSetResistance(subunit, resistance)

# Retrive current resistance of given subunit
resistance = card.ResGetResistance(subunit)

print("Resistance:", resistance)

# Set Resistance with specific mode:
#    RES_Mode.SET                     # Legacy/Default mode to support existing break before make with settling delay
#    RES_Mode.MBB                     # New mode to suport make before break with settling delay
#    RES_Mode.APPLY_PATTERN_IMMEDIATE # Apply new pattern immediately and wait till settling delay
#    RES_Mode.NO_SETTLING_DELAY       # Disable settling delay,same as DriverMode NO_WAIT, but at sub-unit level
#    RES_Mode.DONT_SET                # Do the calculations but don't set the card

# Set with make-before-break mode 
resistance = card.ResSetResistance(subunit, resistance, mode=pilxi.RES_Mode.MBB)


```

## Operate Attenuator ##

Attenuators have specific functions for controlling them. To set attenuation use `SetAttenuation()` providing the subunit and attenuation expressed in decibels. To retrieve the current attenuation use `GetAttenuation()` giving the subunit. It returns an error code and the attenuation expressed in decibels. Please see below for worked examples on how to use these functions:

```python
# Setting Attenuation
attenuation = 1.5     # Attenuation in dB
card.SetAttenuation(subunit, attenuation)

# Retrieving Attenuation
attenuation = card.GetAttenuation(subunit)

print("Attenuation (dB):", attenuation)
```

## Operate Power Supply ##

Power Supplies have specific functions for controlling them. To set voltage use `PsuSetVoltage()` providing the subunit and voltage. To retrieve voltage use `PsuGetVoltage()` giving the subunit. To enable output use `PsuEnable` providing the subunit and the state to be set. Please see below for worked examples on how to use these functions:

```python
# Set Voltage
volts = 3.3
card.PsuSetVoltage(subunit, volts)

# Enable output
card.PsuEnable(subunit, 1)

# Get Voltage
volts = card.PsuGetVoltage(subunit)

# Disable output
card.PsuEnable(subunit, 0)
```

## Operate Battery Simulator ##

Battery Simulators have specific methods for controlling them. To set voltage use `BattSetVoltage()` providing the subunit and voltage. To retrieve the voltage set use `BattGetVoltage()` giving the subunit. To set current use `BattSetcurrent()` providing the subunit and current. To retrieve the set current use `BattGetcurrent()` giving the subunit. To enable output use `BattSetEnable()` providing the subunit and the state to be set. To retrieve the present output state use `BattGetEnable()`. On supported Battery Simulator cards, real channel voltage and current can be measured back using `BattMeasureVoltage()` and `BattMeasureCurrentmA()` methods. Please see below for worked examples on how to use these functions:

```python
volts = 3.3
current = 0.5

# Set Voltage
card.BattSetVoltage(subunit, volts)

# Set Current
card.BattSetCurrent(subunit, current)

# Enable Output
card.BattSetEnable(subunit, True)

# Get Voltage
volts = card.BattGetVoltage(subunit)

# Set Current
current = card.BattGetCurrent(subunit)

# Get Output state
state = card.BattGetEnable(subunit)
```

If you attempt to enable the outputs of a battery simulator card without the hardware interlock, `BattSetEnable()` will throw an exception (error code 70, hardware interlock error). Therefore it is important to call functions in a `try` block and handle errors appropriately.

### 41-752A-01x functionality 

The 41-752A-01x battery simulator cards have extra capabilities beyond what is supported by other cards. Please consult your manual for information on your product's capabilities. Worked examples on using the extra functionality are below:

```python
# The following functionality is not supported by all battery simulator
# cards. Please consult your product manual for information on your card's 
# functionality. 

# Enable set-measure-set mode (increases measurement accuracy on supported cards)
card.BattSetMeasureSet(subunit, True)

# Configure measurement mode to alter device accuracy/sampling: 
numSamples                  = pilxi.BattNumSamples.SAMPLES_128     # Average values after 128 samples
VConversionTimePerSample    = pilxi.BattConversionTime.T_1052us    # 1052 us voltage sample time
IConversionTimePerSample    = pilxi.BattConversionTime.T_540us     # 540 us current sample time
triggerMode                 = pilxi.BattOperationMode.CONTINUOUS   # Measure continuously (no wait for trigger)

card.BattSetMeasureConfig(subunit, numSamples, VConversionTimePerSample, IConversionTimePerSample, triggerMode)

# The battery simulator (41-752A-01x) has the capability to take into consideration the load
# at which the voltage must be provided. Calculated data for voltage at different loads are
# used to provide this functionality.
load = 100  # units: mA
card.BattSetLoad(subunit, load)

# Measure channel voltage
voltage = card.BattMeasureVoltage(subunit)

# Measure channel current (in milliamps)
currentmA = card.BattMeasureCurrentmA(subunit)

# Measure channel current (in amps)
current = card.BattMeasureCurrentA(subunit)


```

## Operate Thermocouple Simulator ##

Thermocouple Simulators have specific functions for controlling them. To set the range use `VsourceSetRange()` providing the subunit and the range. To retrieve the range use `VsourceGetRange()` providing the subunit. To set the voltage use `VsourceSetVoltage()` providing the subunit and the voltage in millivolts. To retrieve the voltage use `VsourceGetVoltage()` providing the subunit. It returns the voltage in millivolts. To enable or disable outputs use `OpBit()` providing the subunit, bit number for the channel isolations, and the state that should be set. To retrieve the state of the outputs use `ViewBit()` providing the subunit and bit number for the channel isolations. Please refer to the product manual for more information on what subunit and bits to operate. To retrieve temperature readings from a connected thermocouple compensation block us `VsourceGetTemperatures()` providing either `card.ATTR["TS_TEMPERATURES_C"]` or `card.ATTR["TS_TEMPERATURES_F"]` for temperature unit. It will return a list of four temperatures. Please see below for worked examples on how to use these functions:

```python
range = 0.0
mvolts = 0.0
range = card.TS_RANGE["AUTO"]

# Set Range
card.VsourceSetRange(subunit, range)

# Get Range
range = card.VsourceGetRange(subunit)

# Set Voltage
card.VsourceSetVoltage(subunit, mvolts)

# Get Voltage
mvolts = card.VsourceGetVoltage(subunit)

# Set Isolation switches (41-760-001)
isosub = 33
card.OpBit(isosub, 1, 1) # Turn Vo1 on
card.OpBit(isosub, 2, 1) # Turn Vcold1 on

card.OpBit(isosub, 1, 0) # Turn Vo1 off
card.OpBit(isosub, 2, 0) # Turn Vcold1 off

# Get Thermocouple subunit information
# This will return a dictionary containing keys corresponding
# to attributes of the thermocouple subunit and their values. 
VsourceInfoDict = card.VsourceInfo(subunit)

for key, value in VsourceInfoDict.items():
    print("Attribute: {}, Value: {}".format(key, value))

# Get Compensation Block Temperatures
temperatures = card.VsourceGetTemperature(card.ATTR["TS_TEMPERATURE_C"])

for temp in temperatures:
    print(temp)

```

## Error Codes ##

Most of the functions in python-pilxi will raise an exception on any errors. The exception is defined in the python module you are using e.g. pilxi, pi620lx, pipslx. 

```python
try:
    # Call pilxi methods here
    # On error, an exception will be raised 

except pilxi.Error as ex:
    # The exception object contains a string description of the error:
    errorMessage = ex.message
    # It is also possible to retrive the error code returned from the driver:
    errorCode = ex.errorCode
```
## Close Card/Session ##

A card and session can be closed when it is no longer used, or the object's destructor can be called:

```python
# Closes individual card.
card.Close()     

# Closes the session with the LXI.
session.Close()   

# Calling the object's destructor or deleting all references will also call
# the driver's Close() method:

del card
del session
```

# Using Pipslx

Pipslx python module can be used to control Pickering `Power Sequencer`, for
example [600-200-001](https://www.pickeringtest.com/en-US/product/lxi-remote-ac-power-management-switch). (Remote AC power management switch)

Here is a code snippet, how to
connect to `Power Sequencer`, begin the startup and shutdown sequences, as well as
getting and setting individual channel states:

```python
# Required imports
import pilxi
import pipslx

# IP address of the LXI Power Management Switch
IP_Address = "192.168.0.244"

# Open a session with the LXI unit and get the session ID
session = pilxi.Pi_Session(IP_Address)
sessionID = session.GetSessionID()

# Open the pipslx library using the LXI session
powerSequencer = pipslx.Pipslx(sessionID)

# Start sequence
powerSequencer.sequence(pipslx.SEQUENCE_START)

# Get the state of a specified channel
channel = 2
state = powerSequencer.get_chan_state(channel)

# Set the state of a specified channel
state = 1
powerSequencer.set_chan_state(channel, state)

emergency = False

if emergency:
    # In an emergency, call shutdown method to immediately disconnect
    # all channels. No sequence times applied.
    powerSequencer.shutdown()
else:
    # Otherwise, begin the regular shutdown sequence
    powerSequencer.sequence(pipslx.SEQUENCE_STOP)

# Close pipslx
powerSequencer.close()

# Close LXI session
session.Close()

```

# Using Pi620lx

The Pi620lx python module can be used to control Pickering 41-620 Function Generator cards installed in an LXI
chassis. The 41-620 3-channel function generator card can be used to generate arbitrarily defined waveforms, as well as standard
waveforms such as sine, square and triangle with variable attenuation and DC offsets. 

Here is some example code for controlling the 41-620 card using Pi620lx:
```python
import pilxi
import pi620lx 

IP_Address = "192.168.1.1"

# Open an LXI session and get the session ID which must be passed to 
# the pi620lx module
session = pilxi.Pi_Session(IP_Address)
sessionID = session.GetSessionID()

# Open the pi620lx library 
pi620base = pi620lx.Base(sessionID)

# Open a card. With no arguments passed, the openCard() method will open the
# first 41-620 card found in the LXI unit. 
bus = 4
device = 14

card = pi620base.openCard(bus, device)

# Set active channel to use
channel = 1
card.setActiveChannel(channel)

# Switch off channel output before configuring it
card.outputOff()

# Set trigger mode to continuous (no trigger)
card.setTriggerMode(card.triggerSources["FRONT"], card.triggerModes["CONT"])

# Set DC offset to generated waveform (float value from -5 to 5 volts)
# The first argument specifies the desired offset voltage;
# the second enables or disables DC offset.
offsetVoltage = 4.0
enableDCOffset = True
card.setOutputOffsetVoltage(offsetVoltage, enableDCOffset)

# Set attenuation to signal amplitude (float value in dB)
attenuation = 3
card.setAttenuation(attenuation)

# Generate a signal
# Signal shape can be defined using constants available with the Pi620_Card class:
shape = card.signalShapes["SINE"]
# shape = card.signalShapes["SQUARE"]
# shape = card.signalShapes["TRIANGLE"]

# Frequency of signal in kHz:
frequency = 1
# Symmetry of signal (0 - 100):
symmetry = 20

try:
    # Start generating a signal. By default, this method will start generating immediately without
    # first calling card.outputOn().
    # card.generateSignal(frequency, shape, symmetry)

    # The card.generateSignal() method can also be used with optional parameters to specify
    # a start phase offset and to enable/disable immediate signal generation.
    # For example, the following call will set the same signal as above, but with a
    # 90 degree phase offset and will disable signal output until card.outputOn() is called:
    card.generateSignal(frequency, shape, symmetry, startPhaseOffset=90, generate=False)

    # Set output on
    card.outputOn()

except pi620lx.Error as error:
    print("Error generating signal:", error.message)

# Close card. Note this will not stop the card generating a signal.
card.close()
```

## Operate 41-625 ##

## 41-670 ##

To operate PXI/PXIe LVDT/RVDT/Resolver Simulator Module, an approach using attributes is needed. Below is the list of Attributes relevant to 41-670.

### General Attributes (applicable in all 41-670 modes) ###
```python
    # Get / Set
    VDT_AUTO_INPUT_ATTEN                   = 0x450, # Sets/Gets DWORD (0-100) for input gain (Default = 100)
    VDT_VOLTAGE_SUM                        = 0x455, # Sets/Gets DOUBLE in Volts  for VSUM value  
    VDT_VOLTAGE_DIFF                       = 0x456, # Sets/Gets DOUBLE in Volts  for VDIFF value (the limit is +/- VSUM)  
    VDT_MANUAL_INPUT_ATTEN                 = 0x458, # Sets/Gets DWORD (0-255) Pot Value on LVDT  
    VDT_MODE                               = 0x459, # Sets/Gets DWORD to set mode 1 = LVDT_5_6_WIRE, mode 2=  LVDT_4_WIRE.
    VDT_DELAY_A                            = 0x45A, # Sets/Gets DWORD (0-6499) delay for OutputA   
    VDT_DELAY_B                            = 0x45B, # Sets/Gets DWORD (0-6499) delay for OutputB

## Using Attributes ##
Most of card specific features are controlled via attributes. Attributes do apply to either specific subunit or whole card. Attributes which apply to your product are listed in it's user manual.

### Setting Attribute Values ###
The Pilxi python library offers a set of functions for setting the attributes. Each functions differs in variable type they are either setting or getting. The functions are
- `SetAttributeDWORD(subunit, outputSubunit, attribute, value)`
  - A **integer** variable is expected to be passed as a `value`.
- `SetAttributeDWORDArray(subunit, outputSubunit, attribute, values)`
  - A **python list** is expected to be passed as a `values`.
- `SetAttributeDouble(subunit, outputSubunit, attribute, value)`
  - A **double** is expected to be passed as a `value`.
- `SetAttributeByte(subunit, outputSubunit, attribute, value)`
  - A **python byte object** is expected to be passed as a `value`.
### Getting Attribute Values ###
The Pilxi python library offers a set of functions for getting the attributes. Each function differs in the variable type they return.
- `GetAttributeDWORD(subunit, outputSubunit, attribute)`
  - Returns an **integer** value.
- `GetAttributeDWORDArray(subunit, outputSubunit, attribute)`
  - Returns a **python list**.
- `GetAttributeDouble(subunit, outputSubunit, attribute)`
  - Returns a **double** value.
- `GetAttributeByte(subunit, outputSubunit, attribute)`
  - Returns a **python bytes object**.

### Attribute List ###
An attribute list can be accessed with
```python
pilxi.<ATTR_NAME>

# Example
card.SetAttributeDWORD(subunit, outputSubunit, pilxi.Attributes.VDT_OUTPUT_GAIN, 128)

out_gain = card.GetAttributeDWORD(subunit, outputSubunit, pilxi.Attributes.VDT_OUT_GAIN)
```
Attributes specific for your product are listed in the user manual of the product. \
**Important**: Attributes in python Pilxi library are without the `ATTR_` prefix.
```
ATTR_TS_SET_RANGE

is

pilxi.Attributes.TS_SET_RANGE
```

# Migrating from old versions of the pilxi Python wrapper 

From wrapper version 4.0 onwards, major changes were made to the Python pilxi wrapper API. Most notably, 
opening/listing cards and error handling conventions have changed. The new wrapper does not rely on returning 
an integer error code from every method, as is conventional in a C program. Instead. Python-style exceptions are 
raised, and the exception contains attributes giving the integer error code, and a human-readable description of
the error. 
### Old wrapper example:

```python
from pilxi import *

# Connect to chassis
ip_address = "192.168.1.1"
port = 1024
timeout = 1000

# Opening a session with LXI device. 
# Note that strings must be encoded with str.encode()
com = pi_comm(0, str.encode(ip_address), port, timeout)

mode = 0            # Last two parameters treated as Bus and Slot
bus = 19
slot = 1
card_obj = pi_card(0, str.encode(ip_address), port, timeout, mode, bus, slot)

column = 1
row = 1
subunit = 1
state = 1

err = card_obj.OpCrosspoint(subunit, row, column, state)

# C-style error checking
# Note that strings must be decoded from byte strings (Python 3.x only)
if err:
    error, err_str = card_obj.ErrorCodeToMessage(err)
    print(err_str.decode())

err = card_obj.OpCrosspoint(subunit, column, row, 0)
if err:
    error, err_str = card_obj.ErrorCodeToMessage(err)
    print(err_str.decode())

# Cards must be closed explicitly or they will not be released
card_obj.CloseSpecifiedCard()

# Session must be closed explicitly or they may be orphaned
com.Disconnect()
```

### New wrapper example:
```python
import pilxi

# Connect to chassis and open a card by bus and device IDs.
# Error checking is done using try/except blocks to catch
# exceptions.
try:
    # Port, timeout parameters are optional, defaults will be used otherwise.
    IP_Address = '192.168.1.5'
    session = pilxi.Pi_Session(IP_Address)

    bus = 19
    device = 1
    card = session.OpenCard(bus, device)
    
except pilxi.Error as ex:
    print("Error connecting to chassis/opening card: ", ex.message)
    print("Driver error code:", ex.errorCode)
    exit()

# Set and unset a matrix crosspoint, with error checking:
try:    
    row = 1
    column = 1
    subunit = 1
    
    card.OpCrosspoint(subunit, row, column, True)
    
    card.OpCrosspoint(subunit, row, column, False)
    
except pilxi.Error as ex:
    print("Error operating crosspoint: ", ex.message)
    print("Driver error code: ", ex.errorCode)
    
# Close session and card explicitly. This is entirely optional, cards and sessions
# will be closed by Python's garbage collection.

card.Close()
session.Close()
```

Function signatures remain largely identical between versions of the wrapper, except error codes are not returned. 
Therefore, previously a function returning a value would also return an error code:
```python
error, resistance = card.ResGetResistance(subunit)
```
Would now become:
```python
resistance = card.ResGetResistance(subunit)
```
Errors would be caught in a try/except block.
