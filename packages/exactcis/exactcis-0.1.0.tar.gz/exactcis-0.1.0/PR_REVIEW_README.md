# PR Review Feedback Automation

This document provides instructions on how to add the PR review feedback to PR #2 without any interactive element, as requested in the issue description.

## Automated Approach

A shell script has been created to automate the process of adding the PR review feedback to PR #2. The script uses the GitHub CLI (gh) to add the review feedback from the `pr_review_feedback.md` file.

### Prerequisites

1. GitHub CLI (gh) must be installed and authenticated
2. The PR review feedback file (`pr_review_feedback.md`) must exist
3. PR #2 must exist in the repository

### Usage

To add the PR review feedback to PR #2, simply execute the following command from the repository root:

```bash
./add_pr_review.sh
```

The script will:
1. Check if GitHub CLI is installed
2. Check if the PR review feedback file exists
3. Add the PR review feedback to PR #2 using the GitHub CLI
4. Provide feedback on the success or failure of the operation

### Troubleshooting

If the script fails to add the PR review feedback, it will provide instructions for manual addition.

## Manual Approach

If the automated approach fails, you can manually add the PR review feedback using the following steps:

1. Go to the PR #2 page on GitHub
2. Click on "Add your review"
3. Copy the content of `pr_review_feedback.md`
4. Paste it into the review comment box
5. Click on "Comment" to submit the review

## Direct GitHub CLI Command

If you prefer to use the GitHub CLI directly without the script, you can use the following command:

```bash
gh pr review 2 --body-file pr_review_feedback.md --comment
```

This command will add the content of `pr_review_feedback.md` as a comment to PR #2.

## Note on Non-Interactive Execution

The script and direct GitHub CLI command are designed to be executed without any interactive element, as requested in the issue description. They will either succeed silently or provide clear error messages and instructions for manual intervention if needed.
