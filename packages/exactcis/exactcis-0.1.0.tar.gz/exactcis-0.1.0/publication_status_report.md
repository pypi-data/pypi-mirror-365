## Issues Requiring Attention

1. **TestPyPI Credentials**: Need TestPyPI API token to proceed with upload
2. **PyPI Credentials**: Need PyPI API token for production release

## Issues Resolved

1. **Version Inconsistency**: ✅ Fixed - The version is now consistently defined as 0.1.0 across all files.
2. **GitHub URLs**: ✅ Fixed - The GitHub URLs in pyproject.toml now use "exactcis" instead of "yourusername".
3. **Email Address**: ✅ Fixed - The email for authors in pyproject.toml now uses a more appropriate address (exactcis-dev@example.org).
4. **Testing Dependencies**: ✅ Fixed - Testing dependencies have been moved from core dependencies to dev dependencies in pyproject.toml.
5. **Unpushed Commits**: ✅ Fixed - All local commits pushed to remote repository.
6. **Package Validation**: ✅ Fixed - Package passes twine check validation.
7. **Build Setup**: ✅ Fixed - Package builds successfully with uv.

## Next Steps

1. Obtain TestPyPI API token from https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/
2. Upload to TestPyPI: `uv run twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*`
3. Verify installation from TestPyPI and test basic import
4. Obtain PyPI API token from https://pypi.org/manage/account/
5. Upload to production PyPI: `uv run twine upload dist/*`
6. Create git tag and GitHub release

## Conclusion

The ExactCIs package is now ready for publication! We have successfully addressed all critical technical issues:

✅ **All Technical Requirements Met:**
1. Version consistency across all files (0.1.0)
2. Proper package metadata and URLs
3. Clean dependency structure
4. Successful package builds
5. Passes twine validation checks
6. All commits pushed to remote repository

✅ **Package Quality:**
- Clean codebase with no version-controlled development files
- Comprehensive test suite
- Performance optimizations implemented
- Documentation structure in place

**Ready for Publication:**
The package is technically ready for immediate publication to PyPI. The only remaining steps are:
1. Obtain API tokens for TestPyPI and PyPI
2. Execute the upload commands
3. Create release tags

**Publication Impact:**
This release represents a significant contribution to the scientific Python ecosystem, providing exact confidence interval methods for odds ratios with optimized performance and comprehensive documentation.
