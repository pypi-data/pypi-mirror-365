"""
Comprehensive comparison tests between ExactCIs Python implementation and R reference values.

This module tests:
1. Consistency with R implementations (allowing for reasonable differences)
2. Internal logical consistency (relative ordering of methods)
3. Statistical properties (OR within CI, proper bounds ordering)
