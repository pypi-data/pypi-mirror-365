A **MCP Forward Proxy Bridge** designed to be a one-to-many bridge that allows you to use a single MCP server to communicate with many MCP servers transparently.

## Overview

The MCP Foxxy Bridge solves the problem of having to configure multiple MCP servers across different AI tools by providing a centralized proxy that:

- **Aggregates multiple MCP servers** into a single interface
- **Exposes all tools, resources, and prompts** from configured MCP servers
- **Routes requests transparently** to the appropriate underlying MCP server
- **Allows you to configure your MCPs in one place** for use across all AI tools

## Quick Start

### Installation

**Recommended: Install via uv**
```bash
uv tool install mcp-foxxy-bridge
```

**Alternative: Install via pipx**
```bash
pipx install mcp-foxxy-bridge
```

**Install latest from git**
```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/billyjbryant/mcp-foxxy-bridge
```

### Basic Usage

**Start bridge with multiple servers:**
```bash
mcp-foxxy-bridge --port 8080 \
  --named-server fetch 'uvx mcp-server-fetch' \
  --named-server github 'npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-github' \
  --named-server filesystem 'npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem'
```

**Start bridge with configuration file:**
```bash
mcp-foxxy-bridge --port 8080 --named-server-config ./servers.json
```

**Connect AI tools to the bridge:**
Your bridge will be available at `http://localhost:8080/sse`

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Add this to your Claude Desktop MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "foxxy-bridge": {
      "command": "mcp-foxxy-bridge",
      "args": ["http://localhost:8080/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Architecture

```
AI Tools (Claude Desktop, VS Code, etc.)
    ‚Üì (SSE/stdio)
MCP Foxxy Bridge
    ‚Üì (stdio to multiple servers)
MCP Server 1, MCP Server 2, MCP Server N
```

The Foxxy Bridge acts as a transparent forward proxy between AI tools and multiple MCP servers, providing:

- **Tool Aggregation**: Unified access to tools from all connected servers
- **Resource Aggregation**: Access to resources across multiple servers
- **Namespace Management**: Automatic tool/resource namespacing to prevent conflicts
- **Request Routing**: Intelligent routing of requests to appropriate servers
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in status endpoint for monitoring server health

## Key Features

- ‚úÖ **One-to-Many Bridge**: Connect multiple MCP servers through a single endpoint
- ‚úÖ **Tool Aggregation**: Unified access to tools from all connected servers
- ‚úÖ **Resource Subscription**: Full support for resource subscriptions and forwarding
- ‚úÖ **Logging Coordination**: Centralized logging level management across all servers
- ‚úÖ **Progress Notifications**: Transparent progress forwarding from managed servers
- ‚úÖ **Completion Aggregation**: Combined autocomplete suggestions from all servers
- ‚úÖ **Namespace Management**: Automatic tool namespacing to prevent conflicts
- ‚úÖ **Environment Variables**: Support for `${VAR_NAME}` expansion in configs
- ‚úÖ **Multiple Deployment Options**: Local process, Docker container, or UV tool
- ‚úÖ **Health Monitoring**: Built-in status endpoint for monitoring
