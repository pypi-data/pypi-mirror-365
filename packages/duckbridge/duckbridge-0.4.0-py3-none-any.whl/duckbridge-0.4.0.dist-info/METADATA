## What is duckbridge?
DuckDB's httpserver extension turns databases into HTTP OLAP servers; however, setup and access require unix commands and SQL in order to properly set up authentication, install the extension, and communicate. 

`duckbridge` spans this gap, providing a way to natively use `httpserver` with full pythonic scripting. The `DuckDBServer` class acts as the bridge operator, connecting to the database, initializing `httpserver`, and setting authentication values and read/write privileges. `DuckDBClient` provides a tidy handler which stores client-side authentication and endpoint information, ensuring one-factor authentication by way of knowledge while returning information as a Pandas DataFrame.
