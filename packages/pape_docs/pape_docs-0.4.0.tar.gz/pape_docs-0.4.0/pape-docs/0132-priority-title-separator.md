# An option for the separator between the priority and the short title in the file name

A **feature proposal**, created on **July 8, 2025**

## Status

In draft

## Description

We should create an option to be read from any `pyproject.toml` we find or an environment variable (perhaps `PAPE_DOCS_PRIORITY_TITLE_SEPARATOR`) to determine what string to put between the priority and the short title in the file name for new notes (default to ` ` (a space)).
