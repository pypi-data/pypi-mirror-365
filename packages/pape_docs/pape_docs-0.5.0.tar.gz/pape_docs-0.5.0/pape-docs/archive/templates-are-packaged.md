# Templates are packaged, not configurable

An **ADR** created on **July 5, 2025**

## Status

Accepted, implemented, and ongoing.

## Decision

The templates for this project should not be configurable by the user. They are coupled to the script, which is okay because this is meant to be an atomic project that reduces the amount of thinking that needs to go into documentation.

This is an opinionated project designed to **prescribe a simple documentation system**. If the user wants something more complex, they can go look elsewhere.
