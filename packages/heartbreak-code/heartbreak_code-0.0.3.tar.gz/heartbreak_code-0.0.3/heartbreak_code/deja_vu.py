Déjà Vu: A Lyrical Machine Learning Framework for HeartbreakCode.

This module provides a high-level, expressive API for training simple machine learning models
and making predictions, leveraging the dramatic lyrical style of HeartbreakCode.
It aims to make advanced data analysis feel native to the language, allowing developers
to "find the patterns" in their data.
