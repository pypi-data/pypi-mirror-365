On The World Stage: WebAssembly Compilation Target for HeartbreakCode.

This module extends the 'Going Platinum' Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compiler to support
WebAssembly (WASM) as a compilation target. This enables HeartbreakCode projects
to be compiled into a platform-agnostic, high-performance bytecode format
runnable in web browsers and other WASM runtimes.
