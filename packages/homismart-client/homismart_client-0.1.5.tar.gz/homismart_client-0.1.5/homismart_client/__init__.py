# homismart_client/homismart_client/__init__.py
"""
Homismart Client Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Python library to interact with Homismart devices via their WebSocket API.

This __init__.py file makes the core components of the library, such as the
HomismartClient, custom exceptions, and key enumerations, available directly
when the 'homismart_client' package is imported.

Usage:
    >>> import asyncio
    >>> from homismart_client import HomismartClient, AuthenticationError
    >>>
    >>> async def main():
    ...     client = HomismartClient(username="your_email", password="your_password")
    ...     try:
    ...         await client.connect()
    ...         # Wait for devices to be populated or for specific events
    ...         await asyncio.sleep(10) # Example: allow time for connection and device discovery
    ...         if client.session:
    ...             print(f"Connected! Found {len(client.session.get_all_devices())} devices.")
    ...             for device_id, device in client.session.get_all_devices().items():
    ...                 print(f"  - {device}")
    ...     except AuthenticationError:
    ...         print("Authentication failed. Please check your credentials.")
    ...     except Exception as e:
    ...         print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    ...     finally:
    ...         if client.is_connected: # Check if client has is_connected attribute
    ...             await client.disconnect()
    >>>
    >>> # To run the example (ensure HOMISMART_USERNAME and HOMISMART_PASSWORD env vars are set):
    >>> # if __name__ == "__main__":
    >>> # asyncio.run(main())
