## Installation

### Method 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)

1. **Install the package with multi-language support:**
```bash
pip install code-graph-mcp ast-grep-py rustworkx
```

2. **Add to Claude Code using CLI:**
```bash
claude mcp add --scope project code-graph-mcp code-graph-mcp
```

3. **Verify installation:**
```bash
claude mcp list
code-graph-mcp --help
```

### Method 2: Install from Source

1. **Clone and setup the project:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd code-graph-mcp
uv sync  # Install dependencies including ast-grep-py
```

2. **Add to your Claude Code configuration:**

For **local project** configuration (recommended):
```bash
# This creates/updates .mcp.json in your current project
claude mcp add --scope project code-graph-mcp uv run code-graph-mcp
```

For **user-wide** configuration:
```bash
# This configures across all your projects
claude mcp add --scope user code-graph-mcp uv run code-graph-mcp
```

3. **Restart Claude Code**

### Method 3: Development Installation

For contributing to the project:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd code-graph-mcp
uv sync --dev
uv build  # Creates wheel and source distribution
```

## Available Tools

The MCP server provides 8 comprehensive analysis tools that work across all 25+ supported languages:

| Tool | Description | Multi-Language Features |
|------|-------------|------------------------|
| `analyze_codebase` | Complete project analysis with structure metrics and complexity assessment | Language detection, framework identification, cross-language dependency mapping |
| `find_definition` | Locate symbol definitions with detailed metadata and documentation | Universal AST traversal, language-agnostic symbol resolution |  
| `find_references` | Find all references to symbols throughout the codebase | Cross-file and cross-language reference tracking |
| `find_callers` | Identify all functions that call a specified function | Multi-language call graph analysis |
| `find_callees` | List all functions called by a specified function | Universal function call detection across languages |
| `complexity_analysis` | Analyze code complexity with refactoring recommendations | Language-specific complexity patterns, universal metrics |
| `dependency_analysis` | Generate module dependency graphs and import relationships | Cross-language dependency detection, circular dependency analysis |
| `project_statistics` | Comprehensive project health metrics and statistics | Multi-language project profiling, maintainability indexing |

## Usage Examples

Once installed, you can use the tools directly in Claude Code for multi-language projects:

```
Analyze this React/TypeScript frontend with Python backend - show me the overall structure and complexity metrics
```

```
Find all references to the function "authenticate" across both the Java services and JavaScript frontend
```

```
Show me functions with complexity higher than 15 across all languages that need refactoring
```

```
Generate a dependency graph showing how the Python API connects to the React components
```

```
Detect code smells and duplicate patterns across the entire multi-language codebase
```

## Development

### Requirements
- Python 3.12+
- UV package manager
- MCP SDK
- ast-grep-py (for multi-language support)
- rustworkx (for high-performance graph operations)

### Running locally
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the server directly
uv run code-graph-mcp --project-root /path/to/your/project --verbose

# Test with help
uv run code-graph-mcp --help
```

### Performance Features
