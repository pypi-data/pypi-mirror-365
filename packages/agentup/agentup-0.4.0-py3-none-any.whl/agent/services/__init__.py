"""AgentUp Service Layer

This module provides a service-oriented architecture for the AgentUp framework,
encapsulating core functionality into cohesive, testable services.

New Services:
- ConfigurationManager: Singleton configuration management with caching
- CapabilityRegistry: Unified capability registration and execution
- AgentBootstrapper: Orchestrates service initialization
- SecurityService: Authentication and authorization
- MiddlewareManager: Middleware configuration and application
- StateManager: Conversation and application state management
- PluginService: Plugin loading and capability registration
- MCPService: Model Context Protocol integration
- PushNotificationService: Push notification handling

Legacy Services (for backwards compatibility):
- ServiceRegistry: External service integration
- CacheService, WebAPIService: External service types
- MultiModalProcessor: Multimodal processing
