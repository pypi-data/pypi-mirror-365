# Admonitions Guide

Admonitions are special callout boxes that help highlight important information in your documentation. They provide visual emphasis and can organize content like warnings, tips, and examples.

## Basic Syntax

### Static Admonitions

Use three exclamation marks (`!!!`) for admonitions that are always visible:

```markdown
!!! note "Optional Custom Title"
    This is the content of the admonition.
    All content lines must be indented with exactly 4 spaces.

    You can include multiple paragraphs, lists, and even code blocks.
```

### Collapsible Admonitions

Use three question marks (`???`) for admonitions that can be collapsed:

```markdown
??? tip "Click to expand this tip"
    This content is hidden by default.
    Users can click the header to expand and view the content.
```

### Expanded Collapsible Admonitions

Use `???+` to create a collapsible admonition that's expanded by default:

```markdown
???+ warning "Important Warning (expanded by default)"
    This content is visible by default.
    Users can still click to collapse it if needed.
```

## Available Admonition Types

The following types are available, each with its own color scheme and icon:

### Informational Types

## Syntax Rules and Requirements

### 1. Indentation
All content within an admonition **must** be indented with exactly 4 spaces:

```markdown
!!! note
    ✓ This line has 4 spaces - correct!
        ✗ This line has 8 spaces - incorrect!
  ✗ This line has 2 spaces - incorrect!
```

### 2. Title Handling
- Titles are optional and must be enclosed in double quotes
- If no title is provided, the type name is capitalized and used as the title

```markdown
!!! tip
    This will have "Tip" as the title

!!! tip "Pro Tip"
    This will have "Pro Tip" as the title
```

### 3. Multi-line Content
Maintain the 4-space indentation for all lines:

```markdown
!!! example "Complete Example"
    Here's a multi-line example with various content:

    - First list item
    - Second list item

    ```python
    def hello():
        print("Hello, World!")
    ```

    And some final text.
```

### 4. Nested Content
You can include any markdown content inside admonitions:

```markdown
!!! note "Nested Content Example"
    You can include:

    **Bold text**, *italic text*, and `inline code`

    > Blockquotes work too!

    1. Numbered lists
    2. With multiple items

    Even tables:

    | Column 1 | Column 2 |
    |----------|----------|
    | Data 1   | Data 2   |
```

## Common Use Cases

### Security Warnings
```markdown
!!! danger "Security Warning"
    Never commit API keys or passwords to your repository!
    Always use environment variables for sensitive data.
```

### Installation Notes
```markdown
!!! info "System Requirements"
    This package requires:
    - Python 3.10 or higher
    - 4GB of RAM minimum
    - 10GB of free disk space
```

### Troubleshooting
```markdown
??? failure "Installation Failed?"
    If you encounter installation errors:

    1. Check your Python version: `python --version`
    2. Update pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
    3. Try installing in a virtual environment
```

### Code Examples
```markdown
???+ example "API Usage Example"
    ```python
    from agentup import Agent

    # Create a new agent
    agent = Agent(name="MyAgent")

    # Start the agent
    agent.start()
    ```
```

## Best Practices

1. **Choose the Right Type**: Use the appropriate admonition type for your content
   - `tip` for helpful suggestions
   - `warning` for important cautions
   - `danger` for critical warnings
   - `example` for code demonstrations

2. **Keep Titles Concise**: Titles should be short and descriptive

3. **Use Collapsible for Long Content**: If the admonition contains lengthy content, consider using the collapsible syntax (`???`)

4. **Be Consistent**: Use the same type for similar content throughout your documentation

5. **Don't Overuse**: Too many admonitions can be distracting. Use them to highlight truly important information

## Troubleshooting

### Content Not Showing
If your admonition content isn't displaying:
- Check that all content lines have exactly 4 spaces of indentation
- Ensure there's a blank line before and after the admonition
- Verify the type is one of the 12 valid types (lowercase)

### Title Not Displaying
- Make sure titles are enclosed in double quotes
- Check for any escaped quotes in the title

### Collapsible Not Working
- Verify you're using `???` (three question marks) not `!!!`
- For expanded by default, ensure you're using `???+` with the plus sign
