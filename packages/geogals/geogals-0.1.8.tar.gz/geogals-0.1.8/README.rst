A publicly available repository for using geostatistical methods on real and simulated galaxy data.


* Free software: MIT license
* Tutorials: https://github.com/astrobenji/GeoGals/tree/main/docs/tutorials
* Further documentation: https://geogals.readthedocs.io/


Features
--------

This package contains functions that enable a user to:

 * Create a semivariogram for real or simulated spatial galaxy data
 * Fit geostatistical models to galaxy data that accounts for a spatially-varying mean, as well as small-scale fluctuations
 * Use kriging to predict values of random fields at observed/unobserved locations
