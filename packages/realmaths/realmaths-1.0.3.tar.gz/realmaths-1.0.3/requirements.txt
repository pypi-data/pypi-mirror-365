# EasyMath - Production Dependencies
#
# EasyMath is designed to have zero external dependencies to ensure
# maximum compatibility and minimal installation footprint.
# 
# All functionality is built using Python's standard library only.
#
# This approach ensures:
# - Fast installation
# - No dependency conflicts
# - Works in restricted environments
# - Minimal security surface area
# - Long-term stability

# No production dependencies required!
# EasyMath uses only Python standard library modules:
# - math (mathematical functions)
# - re (regular expressions for parsing)
# - typing (type hints)

# Note: Python 3.7+ is required for modern features like:
# - Type hints
# - f-strings
# - Dataclasses (if used in future versions)
