# aoc-data

> Real data to test your Advent of Code solutions

This package provides an example set of inputs and outputs to test
your [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions against.

It's one thing to know your code happens to spit out the correct answers given your own
assigned input for an AoC puzzle.
This project prevents coincidences by allowing you to test your code against several
inputs.
