"""
statz - Cross-platform system information and monitoring library.

A comprehensive Python library for retrieving system specifications, 
hardware usage statistics, process information, temperature readings,
health scores, and performance benchmarks across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Key Features:
- System specifications (CPU, GPU, RAM, disk, network, battery)
- Real-time hardware usage monitoring
- Process monitoring and analysis
- Temperature sensor readings
- System health scoring
- Performance benchmarking
- Export functionality (JSON and CSV)

Example Usage:
    import statz
    
    # Get all system specs
    specs = statz.get_system_specs()
    
    # Get current hardware usage
    usage = statz.get_hardware_usage()
    
    # Get top processes
    processes = statz.get_top_n_processes(10, "cpu")
    
    # Run system health check
    health = statz.system_health_score()
