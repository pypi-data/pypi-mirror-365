    '''
    Get temperature readings from system sensors across all platforms.
    
    This function provides cross-platform temperature monitoring by detecting the operating system
    and calling the appropriate platform-specific temperature reading function.
    
    Returns:
        dict or None: Temperature data structure varies by platform:
        
        **macOS**: Dictionary with sensor names as keys and temperatures in Celsius as values
        Example: {"CPU": 45.2, "GPU": 38.5, "Battery": 32.1}
        
        **Linux**: Dictionary with sensor names as keys and temperatures in Celsius as values
        Example: {"coretemp-isa-0000": 42.0, "acpi-0": 35.5}
        
        **Windows**: Dictionary with thermal zone names as keys and temperatures in Celsius as values
        Example: {"ThermalZone _TZ.TZ00": 41.3, "ThermalZone _TZ.TZ01": 38.9}
        
        Returns None if temperature sensors are not available or accessible on the system.
    
    Raises:
        Exception: If temperature reading fails due to system access issues or sensor unavailability.
    
    Note:
        - Temperature readings may require elevated privileges on some systems
        - Not all systems expose temperature sensors through standard interfaces
        - Results vary based on available hardware sensors and system configuration
