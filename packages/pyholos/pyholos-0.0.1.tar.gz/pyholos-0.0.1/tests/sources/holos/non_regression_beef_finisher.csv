# For Heifers:
# ------------
# The value of "Start Weight" was changed from 350 to 300 kg, in agreement with the source code of Holos in Table_16_Livestock_Coefficients_BeefAndDairy_Cattle_Provider
# The value of "End Weight" was changed from 554 to 580 kg, in agreement with the source code of Holos in Table_16_Livestock_Coefficients_BeefAndDairy_Cattle_Provider
# The value of "Average Daily Gain" was updated correspondingly from 1.2 to 1.6471 kg/day
# The "Methane Conversion Factor Of Diet" value was set to 0.065 (which is calculated based on total digestible nutrient) instead of 0.035 (which is a hard-coded value for LabelBarleyGrainBasedDiet in Holos).

# For Steers:
# ------------
# The value of "Start Weight" was changed from 350 to 310 kg, in agreement with the source code of Holos in Table_16_Livestock_Coefficients_BeefAndDairy_Cattle_Provider
# The value of "End Weight" was changed from 554 to 610 kg, in agreement with the source code of Holos in Table_16_Livestock_Coefficients_BeefAndDairy_Cattle_Provider
# The value of "Average Daily Gain" was updated correspondingly from 1.2 to 1.7647 kg/day
# The value of "Gain coefficient" was changed from 0.8 to 1.0, in agreement with the source code of Holos in Table_16_Livestock_Coefficients_BeefAndDairy_Cattle_Provider
# The "Methane Conversion Factor Of Diet" value was set to 0.065 (which is calculated based on total digestible nutrient) instead of 0.035 (which is a hard-coded value for LabelBarleyGrainBasedDiet in Holos).
# The "Dietary Net Energy Concentration" value was set to 13.642 (which is calculated based on metabolizable energy) instead of 0 (which is a hard-coded (wrongly initialized?)).
