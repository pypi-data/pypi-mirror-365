The simplest usage for PyHolos would be as a Python launcher for the Holos CLI. In this case, the user must have
prepared all the required input files for Holos CLI (i.e. farm folder with animal data CSVs and **Farm.settings** file).

PyHolos can also be useful for user's with a minimum amount of data. In that case, PyHolos can be used to estimate the
values of the missing inputs, to structure the data, and to produce the files required by Holos CLI.
