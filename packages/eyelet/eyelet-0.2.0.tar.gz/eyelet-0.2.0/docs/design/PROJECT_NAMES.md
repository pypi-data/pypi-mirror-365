# Project Name Evolution: Hook Manager → Rigging → Eyelet

## Final Decision: EYELET ⭐

The project has evolved from "rigging" to **EYELET** - a hardware connection point theme that better represents the tool's purpose as a reliable attachment point for AI agent workflows.

## Original Name Ideas for Hook Manager

## Nautical/Pirate Theme (Playing off "Hook")
- **Grapple** - Clean, action-oriented, implies hooking/grabbing
- **Rigging** - Naval term for ship's ropes and hooks
- **Bosun** (Boatswain) - Ship officer who manages rigging
- **Anchor** - Hooks and holds
- **Tether** - Connection/binding theme

## Fishing Theme
- **Angler** - One who uses hooks professionally
- **Tackle** - Fishing gear including hooks
- **Lure** - Attracts and hooks
- **Snag** - Quick, catchy, implies catching/hooking

## Technical/Development Theme
- **Intercept** - Clear about what it does
- **Mesh** - Network of interconnections
- **Nexus** - Connection point
- **Conduit** - Channel for flow
- **Relay** - Pass messages along

## Action/Tool Theme
- **Grapnel** - Multi-hooked tool
- **Snare** - Capture mechanism
- **Latch** - Hooking mechanism
- **Clutch** - Grab and hold

## Clever Wordplay
- **Hookwright** - Like playwright, someone who crafts hooks
- **Rigger** - Sets up complex hook systems
- **Linkforge** - Creating connections
- **Flowgate** - Controls the flow of operations

## My Top Recommendations

### 1. **Grapple** ⭐
- Short, memorable, action-oriented
- `uvx grapple` looks great
- Works as both noun and verb
- No trademark conflicts likely

### 2. **Rigging** ⭐
- Perfect metaphor for hook infrastructure
- `uvx rigging` feels professional
- Naval theme without being cheesy
- "Let me check the rigging" sounds natural

### 3. **Tackle** ⭐
- Fishing tackle = hook equipment
- "Tackle the problem" wordplay
- `uvx tackle` is punchy
- Easy to remember

### 4. **Hookwright**
- Unique and memorable
- Clear purpose
- Bit longer but distinctive
- Great for branding

### 5. **Snag**
- Super short (4 letters!)
- `uvx snag` is instant
- "Snag those hooks" works
- Memorable and fun

## Command Examples
```bash
# Grapple
uvx grapple configure
uvx grapple template install monitoring
uvx grapple logs --tail

# Rigging
uvx rigging setup
uvx rigging deploy observability
uvx rigging inspect

# Tackle
uvx tackle hooks add pre-tool-use
uvx tackle template apply security
uvx tackle monitor

# Snag
uvx snag init
uvx snag hook bash validator
uvx snag watch
```

## Final Thoughts (Historical)
I lean toward **Grapple** or **Rigging** - they're professional, memorable, and the maritime theme fits perfectly with "hooks" without being too cute. Both would look great on a README and are easy to say in conversation: "Just install grapple to manage your hooks" or "Set up rigging for your workflow automation."

## Evolution to Eyelet

After implementing the project as "Rigging", we evolved to **EYELET** for these reasons:

### Why Eyelet Works Better
- **Hardware metaphor**: Eyelets are actual hardware connection points - stronger metaphor than naval rigging
- **Professional but approachable**: Not too technical, not too nautical
- **Perfect verb usage**: "Thread through the eyelet" naturally describes connecting workflows
- **Short and memorable**: 6 letters, easy to type as `uvx eyelet`
- **Clear purpose**: Everyone knows what an eyelet does - it provides a strong connection point

### Command Examples with Eyelet
```bash
# Clean, simple commands
uvx eyelet configure
uvx eyelet template install monitoring  
uvx eyelet logs --tail
uvx eyelet validate settings

# Natural language fit
"Thread your workflow through the eyelet"
"Secure the connection with eyelet"
"All your hooks connect through eyelet"
```

### Thematic Consistency
- Connection points instead of naval equipment
- Hardware reliability instead of maritime adventure  
- Engineering precision instead of seafaring tradition
- Strong attachment points for AI agent workflows
