# TODO

**NOTE**: This TODO need to be written in markdown. use `[ ]` or `[x]` to mark todos

**High velocity** is required but make sure to do it with low overhead.

## SQLite API

What API should we bring? These todo's is for simplification; you can do anything with `Database.sql` property

- [x] sqlite function support
- [x] sqlite aggregate function support
- [x] sqlite window function support
- [x] sqlite collation support
- [x] sqlite pragma
- [x] sqlite branching subquery (??)
- [ ] sqlite 'as' keyword (??)
- [x] sqlite select data crunching[^1] by using Database config option (crunch=True)
- [x] sqlite select 'only' data. Instead of using `select *`, we should also have `only`. Bring up few data than select everything.[^2]
- [x] Provide caching functions; not to cache sql returns but sql query, etc.[^3]

## Other functionality

The functionality here is outside of sqlite features such as export and import.

- [ ] YAML/JSON/TOML/CUSTOM scheme/table include
- [x] CSV Export
- [x] CSV Import

1. abc
   - a
   - b

[^1]: The term data crunching is when `select*` is used, typically the functions returns list of `Row`, by using `crunch=True`, the return value should be `Row[str, tuple[Any]]`
[^2]: If `only` parameter is specified to 1, we should return `tuple[Any, ...]` instead of `list[Row[str, Any]]` or `Row[str, Any]`
[^3]: Caching should **NOT** cache query data! Provide using `combine_keyvals` to create named params
