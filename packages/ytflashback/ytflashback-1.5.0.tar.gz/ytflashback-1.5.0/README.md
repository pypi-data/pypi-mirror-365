A CLI tool for searching YouTube videos by specific year, helping you discover older content that might be buried by YouTube's algorithm favoring newer videos.

## Why?
YouTube's search filters are notoriously poor, especially when trying to find older content. Even though there's a wealth of YouTube videos buried deep in the site, we often can't find them because only the newest ones show up in search results (I believe at any given time you can only see videos from the past year). This tool solves that problem by allowing you to search for videos from specific years. 

## Features

- Search YouTube videos by specific year
- Display results in a clean, formatted table
- Get direct video URLs 

## Setup
