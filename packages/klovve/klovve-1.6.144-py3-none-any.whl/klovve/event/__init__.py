class Event:

    Base class for Klovve events.

    Events are a mechanism to notify and handle all kinds of runtime situations like user input or relevant changes of
    the system state. Whenever something relevant happens, some piece of code can trigger an event. Objects can have
    event handlers registered for that kind of event. All these handlers get executed when an event is triggered for
    that object.

    As long as the event handling is not stopped, events usually bubble up the ancestors, so they can also be handled
    there.

    There must be one subclass for each kind of event that needs to be considered. They often also contain further
    specific information. On observer side, event handlers are registered for some of these subclasses.
