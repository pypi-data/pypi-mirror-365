    Convenience function that prepares a viwid environment (i.e. it starts a driver) in a simple way.

    To be used in a `with` statement. In that context, it provides you with a :py:class:`viwid.drivers.Driver`, which
    can be used to set up the application (create the main window, wire up event handlers, etc.). As soon as you leave
    the `with`-context, the driver takes over the execution of your application (inside an event loop). As soon as no
    application is running anymore, it will stop the driver again and return.

    So, usually, virtually the entire application lifespan is happening between the end of your `with`-statement and
    the moment this function returns. Once it does, your application is considered to be terminated.

    See also the sample applications.

    There must be no event loop already running in the current thread!

    :param event_loop: The event loop to use. If unspecified, a new one will be created.
