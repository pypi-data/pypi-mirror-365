Klovve variables can store arbitrary data and can be observed in order to handle changes.

They are mostly used internally, e.g. by properties of :py:class:`klovve.model.Model`, UI elements, and some others.
They are part of the foundation for their reactive behavior. Klovve applications do not use them directly.
