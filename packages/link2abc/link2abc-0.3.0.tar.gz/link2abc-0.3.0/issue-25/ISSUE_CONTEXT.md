## Issue Description
## 🎵 Enhancement Request: Link2ABC Integration with HuggingFace ChatMusician Pipeline

**♠️🌿🎸🤖🧵 G.MUSIC ASSEMBLY MODE ACTIVE**

### 🎯 Background & Context

We have a **Link2ABC system** that converts web content to ABC music notation with AI enhancement capabilities. We want to integrate it with the **orpheuspypractice HuggingFace ChatMusician workflow** for professional music enhancement and cost-optimized cloud processing.

**Current Link2ABC Features:**
- Converts any web URL to ABC notation
- Local ChatMusician integration (localhost:8000)
- Multiple output formats: ABC, MIDI, MP3, SVG, JPG
- Pipeline architecture supporting custom processing blocks
- Outputs to organized directory structure

**Discovered Integration Opportunity:**
- orpheuspypractice `ohfi` command (`jgthfcli_main`) provides HuggingFace ChatMusician API access
- `wfohfi_then_oabc_foreach_json_files` workflow demonstrates batch processing patterns
- `omusical.yaml` configuration system for ChatMusician prompts

### 🔄 Current vs Proposed Workflow

#### **Current Link2ABC Flow:**
```
URL → Extract Content → Analyze → Generate ABC → Convert to Multiple Formats
```

#### **Proposed Integrated Flow:**
```
URL → Extract → Analyze → Generate Basic ABC → [HF ChatMusician Enhancement] → Enhanced ABC + Audio → Convert All Formats
```

### 🎼 Technical Requirements

#### **1. Machine Lifecycle Management**
- **Auto-start**: Boot HuggingFace endpoint when enhancement requested
- **Processing**: Send ABC notation + custom prompts to ChatMusician
- **Auto-shutdown**: Terminate endpoint after configurable timeout for cost control
- **Session batching**: Queue multiple requests to optimize machine utilization

#### **2. Cost Optimization Features**
- **Budget Controls**: Per-session and daily spending limits
- **Usage Tracking**: Log costs, processing times, and API calls
- **Intelligent Batching**: Group requests to minimize startup/shutdown cycles
- **Fallback Strategy**: Graceful degradation to local generation if budget exceeded

#### **3. Enhanced Pipeline Integration**
```python
# New Pipeline Step: Insert between MusicGenerator and FormatConverter
class HuggingFaceOrpheusBlock:
    - Manages ohfi command calls
    - Handles HF endpoint lifecycle
    - Creates dynamic omusical.yaml configurations
    - Processes both original and enhanced outputs
```

#### **4. Output Management**
```
output/
├── original/
│   ├── content.abc
│   ├── content.mid
│   └── content.mp3
└── enhanced/
    ├── content_enhanced.abc
    ├── content_enhanced.mid
    ├── content_enhanced.mp3
    └── content_enhanced_audio.wav  # HF ChatMusician audio output
```

### ❓ Implementation Questions

1. **Input Format**: Can `ohfi` command accept ABC notation as input alongside custom prompts in `omusical.yaml`?

2. **Endpoint Management**: What's the optimal way to use `jghfmanager` for HuggingFace endpoint lifecycle management?

3. **Prompt Templates**: Are there specific prompt templates that work best with ChatMusician for ABC notation enhancement?

4. **Integration Patterns**: How should we structure the `OrpheusIntegrationBlock` to call `jgthfcli_main` internally?

5. **Output Handling**: How does ChatMusician return enhanced ABC notation and audio files through the `ohfi` interface?

### 🏗️ Proposed Implementation Architecture

#### **New Components:**
1. **`OrpheusIntegrationBlock`**: Main integration component
2. **`HFEndpointManager`**: Wraps `jghfmanager` functionality  
3. **`MusicalPromptManager`**: Dynamic `omusical.yaml` generation
4. **`EnhancedFormatConverter`**: Handles dual output management

#### **CLI Enhancement:**
```bash
# Basic enhancement
l2a https://example.com --enhance-hf

# Custom prompt with cost control  
l2a https://example.com --enhance-hf --hf-prompt "Make jazz-influenced with complex harmonies" --hf-budget 0.50

# Batch processing mode
l2a https://example.com --enhance-hf --keep-alive 300  # Keep HF alive for 5 minutes
```

### 🎯 Expected Benefits

1. **Professional AI Music Enhancement**: Users get both basic rule-based AND professional AI-generated music
2. **Cost-Optimized HuggingFace Usage**: Smart endpoint management minimizes cloud costs
3. **Seamless Integration**: Two complementary music generation systems working together
4. **Enhanced User Experience**: Dual output options (original + enhanced) with transparent processing
5. **Community Value**: Reusable integration patterns for other music AI projects

### 🔗 Integration Points

- **Link2ABC Pipeline**: Already supports custom processing blocks via modular architecture
- **orpheuspypractice Workflow**: `ohfi` command provides proven HuggingFace ChatMusician access
- **Cost Management**: Both systems need efficient cloud resource usage
- **Output Compatibility**: Both systems work with ABC notation and multiple audio formats

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Dependencies Analysis**: Install and test `jgcmlib>=1.0.59` and `jghfmanager>=0.1.5`
2. **Command Study**: Analyze `ohfi` command implementation and `omusical.yaml` format
3. **Prototype Development**: Create basic `OrpheusIntegrationBlock` proof of concept
4. **Cost Testing**: Validate auto-shutdown and budget control mechanisms
5. **Documentation**: Create integration guide and usage examples

### 📋 Technical Specifications

**Dependencies:**
- `jgcmlib>=1.0.59` (ABC processing and conversion)
- `jghfmanager>=0.1.5` (HuggingFace endpoint management)
- `link2abc` (target integration system)

**Environment Requirements:**
- HuggingFace API access and credentials
- ChatMusician model endpoint configuration
- Budget and cost tracking setup

**Testing Requirements:**
- Integration tests with actual HF endpoints
- Cost optimization validation
- Fallback scenario testing
- Multi-format output verification
