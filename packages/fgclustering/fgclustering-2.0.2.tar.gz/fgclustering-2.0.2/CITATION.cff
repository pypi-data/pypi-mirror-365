  This python package is about explainability of
  Random Forest models. Standard explainability
  methods (e.g. feature importance) assume
  independence of model features and hence, are not
  suited in the presence of correlated features. The
  Forest-Guided Clustering algorithm does not assume
  independence of model features, because it computes
  the feature importance based on subgroups of
  instances that follow similar decision rules within
  the Random Forest model. Hence, this method is well
  suited for cases with high correlation among model
  features.
