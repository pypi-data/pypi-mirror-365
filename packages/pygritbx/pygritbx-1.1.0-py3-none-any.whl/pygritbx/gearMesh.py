'''
This is the "Gear Mesh" class.
It defines a gear mesh by relying on 2 gear components and the type of mesh.

The properties used are:
I) Given properties
--> 1) "drivingGear": a gear component representing the input gear of the gear mesh
--> 2) "drivenGear": a gear component represnting the output gear of the gear mesh
--> 3) "radiality": a 1/2-element vector where each element is composed of 3-element vector representing the direction along which the centers of the driving gear and the driven gear centers are connected with the teeth contact point
--> 4) "type": a string of characters indicating the gear mesh type: Internal / External

II) Calculated properties
--> 1) "ratio": the gear ratio calculated based on the number of teeth
--> 2) "m_G": the reciprocal of the gear ratio
--> 3) "loc": a 3-element vector representing the location of the gear mesh with respect to the origin [0, 0, 0]
--> 4) "F": a 3-element vector representing the resultant force acting on the driven gear due to the gear mesh object defined
--> 5) "F_t": a 3-element vector representing the tangential force component of the resultant force
--> 6) "F_r": a 3-element vector representing the radial force component of the resultant force
--> 7) "F_a": a 3-element vector representing the axial force component of the resultant force
