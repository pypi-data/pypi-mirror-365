# Information Retrieval for experimaestro

Information Retrieval module for [experimaestro](https://experimaestro-python.readthedocs.io/)

The full documentation can be read at [IR@experimaestro](https://experimaestro-ir.readthedocs.io/).

You can find experiments built on top of XPMIR on the [xpmir github workspace](https://github.com/orgs/xpmir/repositories).

Finally, you can find the [roadmap](https://github.com/experimaestro/experimaestro-ir/issues/9).

## Install

Base experimaestro-IR can be installed with `pip install xpmir`.
Functionalities can be added by installing optional dependencies:

- `pip install xpmir[neural]` to install neural-IR packages (torch, etc.)
- `pip install xpmir[anserini]` to install Anserini related packages

For the development version, you can:

- If you just want the development version: install with `pip install git+https://github.com/experimaestro/experimaestro-ir.git`
- If you want to edit the code: clone and then do a `pip install -e .` within the directory
