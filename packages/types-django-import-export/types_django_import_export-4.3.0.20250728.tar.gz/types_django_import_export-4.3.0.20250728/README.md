## Typing stubs for django-import-export

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/) type stub package for
the [`django-import-export`](https://github.com/django-import-export/django-import-export) package. It can be used by type checkers
to check code that uses `django-import-export`. This version of
`types-django-import-export` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`django-import-export==4.3.*`.

This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/django-import-export`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/django-import-export)
directory.

This package was tested with the following type checkers:
* [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/) 1.16.1
* [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) 1.1.403
