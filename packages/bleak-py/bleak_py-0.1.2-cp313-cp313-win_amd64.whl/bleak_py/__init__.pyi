        Perform a write operation on the specified GATT characteristic.

        There are two possible kinds of writes. *Write with response* (sometimes
        called a *Request*) will write the data then wait for a response from
        the remote device. *Write without response* (sometimes called *Command*)
        will queue data to be written and return immediately.

        Each characteristic may support one kind or the other or both or neither.
        Consult the device's documentation or inspect the properties of the
        characteristic to find out which kind of writes are supported.

        Args:
            character:
                The characteristic to write to, specified by either integer
                handle, UUID or directly by the :class:`~bleak.backends.characteristic.BleakGATTCharacteristic`
                object representing it. If a device has more than one characteristic
                with the same UUID, then attempting to use the UUID wil fail and
                a characteristic object must be used instead.
            data:
                The data to send. When a write-with-response operation is used,
                the length of the data is limited to 512 bytes. When a
                write-without-response operation is used, the length of the
                data is limited to :attr:`~bleak.backends.characteristic.BleakGATTCharacteristic.max_write_without_response_size`.
                Any type that supports the buffer protocol can be passed.
            response:
                If ``True``, a write-with-response operation will be used. If
                ``False``, a write-without-response operation will be used.
                Omitting the argument is deprecated and may raise a warning.
                If this arg is omitted, the default behavior is to check the
                characteristic properties to see if the "write" property is
                present. If it is, a write-with-response operation will be
                used. Note: some devices may incorrectly report or omit the
                property, which is why an explicit argument is encouraged.
