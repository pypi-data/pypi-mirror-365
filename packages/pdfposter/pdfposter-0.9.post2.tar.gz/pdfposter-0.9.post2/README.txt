``Pdfposter`` can be used to create a large poster by building it from
multiple pages and/or printing it on large media. It expects as input a
PDF file, normally printing on a single page. The output is again a
PDF file, maybe containing multiple pages together building the
poster.
The input page will be scaled to obtain the desired size.

This is much like ``poster`` does for Postscript files, but working
with PDF. Since sometimes poster does not like your files converted
from PDF. :-) Indeed ``pdfposter`` was inspired by ``poster``.
