# Twitter Plugin for GAME SDK

The **Twitter Plugin** provides a lightweight interface for integrating Twitter (X) functionality into your GAME SDK agents. Built on top of [`virtuals_tweepy`](https://pypi.org/project/virtuals-tweepy/) by the Virtuals team â€” a maintained fork of [`Tweepy`](https://pypi.org/project/tweepy/)) â€” this plugin lets you easily post tweets, fetch data, and execute workflows through agent logic.

Visit the following URL to authenticate:

#### 2. Store Your Access Token

We recommend storing environment variables in a `.env` file:

```
# .env

GAME_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=apx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Then, use `load_dotenv()` to load them:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from twitter_plugin_gamesdk.twitter_plugin import TwitterPlugin

load_dotenv()

options = {
    "credentials": {
        "game_twitter_access_token": os.environ.get("GAME_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN")
    }
}

twitter_plugin = TwitterPlugin(options)
client = twitter_plugin.twitter_client

client.create_tweet(text="Tweeting with GAME Access Token!")
```
