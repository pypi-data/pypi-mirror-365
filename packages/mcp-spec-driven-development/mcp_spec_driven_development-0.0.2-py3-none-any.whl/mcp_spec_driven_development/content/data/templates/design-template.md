## Architecture Patterns

### Layered Architecture
```mermaid
graph TB
    UI[User Interface Layer]
    BL[Business Logic Layer]
    DL[Data Access Layer]
    DB[Database Layer]

    UI --> BL
    BL --> DL
    DL --> DB
```

### Microservices Architecture
```mermaid
graph TB
    API[API Gateway]
    S1[Service 1]
    S2[Service 2]
    S3[Service 3]
    DB1[(Database 1)]
    DB2[(Database 2)]

    API --> S1
    API --> S2
    API --> S3
    S1 --> DB1
    S2 --> DB2
    S3 --> DB1
```

### Event-Driven Architecture
```mermaid
graph TB
    P[Producer]
    EB[Event Bus]
    C1[Consumer 1]
    C2[Consumer 2]
    C3[Consumer 3]

    P --> EB
    EB --> C1
    EB --> C2
    EB --> C3
```

## Component Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern
```python
class UserRepository:
    def create(self, user: User) -> User:
        """Create new user record."""
        pass

    def get_by_id(self, user_id: str) -> Optional[User]:
        """Retrieve user by ID."""
        pass

    def update(self, user: User) -> User:
        """Update existing user."""
        pass

    def delete(self, user_id: str) -> bool:
        """Delete user by ID."""
        pass
```

### Service Layer Pattern
```python
class UserService:
    def __init__(self, user_repo: UserRepository):
        self.user_repo = user_repo

    def register_user(self, user_data: dict) -> User:
        """Register new user with validation."""
        # Business logic here
        pass

    def authenticate_user(self, credentials: dict) -> Optional[User]:
        """Authenticate user credentials."""
        # Authentication logic here
        pass
```

## Error Handling Patterns

### Result Pattern
```python
from typing import Union, Generic, TypeVar

T = TypeVar('T')
E = TypeVar('E')

class Result(Generic[T, E]):
    def __init__(self, value: T = None, error: E = None):
        self.value = value
        self.error = error

    def is_success(self) -> bool:
        return self.error is None

    def is_error(self) -> bool:
        return self.error is not None
```

### Exception Hierarchy
```python
class ApplicationError(Exception):
    """Base application exception."""
    pass

class ValidationError(ApplicationError):
    """Data validation error."""
    pass

class AuthenticationError(ApplicationError):
    """Authentication failure."""
    pass

class AuthorizationError(ApplicationError):
    """Authorization failure."""
    pass
```

## Testing Patterns

### Unit Test Structure
```python
class TestUserService:
    def setup_method(self):
        """Set up test fixtures."""
        self.mock_repo = Mock(spec=UserRepository)
        self.service = UserService(self.mock_repo)

    def test_register_user_success(self):
        """Test successful user registration."""
        # Arrange
        user_data = {"email": "test@example.com", "password": "secure123"}
        expected_user = User(email="test@example.com")
        self.mock_repo.create.return_value = expected_user

        # Act
        result = self.service.register_user(user_data)

        # Assert
        assert result == expected_user
        self.mock_repo.create.assert_called_once()
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with Requirements**: Ensure design addresses all requirements
2. **Think in Components**: Break complex systems into manageable parts
3. **Document Decisions**: Explain why choices were made
4. **Use Diagrams**: Visual representations clarify complex relationships
5. **Consider Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, scalability
6. **Plan for Testing**: Design with testability in mind
7. **Get Feedback**: Review with stakeholders and team members
8. **Iterate as Needed**: Refine design based on feedback and new insights
