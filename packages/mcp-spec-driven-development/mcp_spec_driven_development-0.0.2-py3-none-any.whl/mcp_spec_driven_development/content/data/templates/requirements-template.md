# Requirements Document

## Introduction

[Provide a brief overview of the feature, its purpose, and context. Explain what problem it solves and why it's needed.]

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a [specific role], I want [specific feature/capability], so that [specific benefit/value].

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN [specific trigger event] THEN [system] SHALL [specific measurable response]
2. IF [specific condition] THEN [system] SHALL [specific measurable response]
3. WHILE [specific system state] THEN [system] SHALL [specific measurable response]
4. WHERE [specific context/location] THEN [system] SHALL [specific measurable response]

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a [specific role], I want [specific feature/capability], so that [specific benefit/value].

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN [specific trigger event] THEN [system] SHALL [specific measurable response]
2. IF [specific condition] THEN [system] SHALL [specific measurable response]

## Writing Guidelines

### Introduction Section
- Keep it concise but informative (2-4 paragraphs)
- Explain the feature's purpose and value
- Provide necessary context for understanding
- Avoid implementation details

### User Stories
- Use specific roles, not generic "user"
- Focus on what the user wants to accomplish
- Explain the benefit or value clearly
- Keep stories independent and testable

### Acceptance Criteria
- Use EARS format consistently
- Cover normal flows, edge cases, and error conditions
- Make criteria specific and measurable
- Ensure each criterion is testable

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Roles are specific and meaningful
- [ ] Features are concrete and actionable
- [ ] Benefits explain the value or motivation

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All criteria use EARS format (WHEN/IF/WHILE/WHERE...THEN...SHALL)
- [ ] Criteria are specific and measurable
- [ ] Normal flows are covered
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions are included
- [ ] All criteria are testable

### Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details are included

## Common Patterns

### Authentication Requirements
```markdown
**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log into the system, so that I can access my personal data.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN user enters valid credentials THEN system SHALL grant access within 2 seconds
2. WHEN user enters invalid credentials THEN system SHALL display error message
3. IF user fails login 3 times THEN system SHALL lock account for 15 minutes
4. WHERE login page THEN system SHALL provide password reset option
```

### Data Management Requirements
```markdown
**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to save my work, so that I don't lose my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN user clicks save button THEN system SHALL persist data within 1 second
2. IF save operation fails THEN system SHALL display error message and retry
3. WHILE save is in progress THEN system SHALL show progress indicator
4. WHERE unsaved changes exist THEN system SHALL prompt before navigation
```

### User Interface Requirements
```markdown
**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the interface to adapt to my screen size, so that I can use the app effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN screen width is less than 768px THEN system SHALL use mobile layout
2. WHERE mobile layout THEN system SHALL stack navigation items vertically
3. IF user rotates device THEN system SHALL adjust layout within 0.5 seconds
4. WHILE loading content THEN system SHALL show loading indicators
```

## Validation Examples

### Good Requirements
✅ **Clear and Testable**
- WHEN user submits valid form data THEN system SHALL save record and display confirmation within 2 seconds

✅ **Specific Conditions**
- IF user account balance is less than $10 THEN system SHALL prevent transaction and show insufficient funds message

✅ **Measurable Outcomes**
- WHERE search results page THEN system SHALL display maximum 20 results per page with pagination

### Poor Requirements
❌ **Vague and Untestable**
- System should be user-friendly and fast

❌ **Implementation Details**
- System shall use MySQL database to store user preferences

❌ **Subjective Criteria**
- Interface should look professional and modern

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with User Needs**: Focus on what users want to accomplish
2. **Be Specific**: Use concrete, measurable criteria
3. **Cover All Scenarios**: Include normal flows, edge cases, and errors
4. **Keep It Simple**: Use clear, straightforward language
5. **Make It Testable**: Ensure every requirement can be validated
6. **Get Feedback Early**: Review with stakeholders frequently
7. **Iterate as Needed**: Refine requirements based on feedback

This template provides a solid foundation for creating comprehensive, testable requirements that serve as the basis for successful feature development.
