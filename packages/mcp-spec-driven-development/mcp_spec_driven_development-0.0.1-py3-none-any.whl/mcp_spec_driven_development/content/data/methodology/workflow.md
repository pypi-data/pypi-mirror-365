# Spec-Driven Development Workflow

## Overview

Spec-driven development is a systematic methodology that transforms feature ideas into implementation plans through a structured three-phase approach. This methodology ensures quality, completeness, and traceability throughout the development process.

## The Three-Phase Approach

### Phase Flow
```
Feature Idea → Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation
```

Each phase builds upon the previous one and includes quality gates to ensure completeness before progression.

## Phase 1: Requirements

**Objective**: Transform rough feature ideas into structured, testable requirements.

**Key Activities**:
- Analyze user needs and business objectives
- Write user stories in standardized format
- Create acceptance criteria using EARS format
- Identify edge cases and error conditions
- Validate requirements with stakeholders

**Deliverable**: `requirements.md` with structured requirements

**Quality Gate**: Explicit stakeholder approval required

## Phase 2: Design

**Objective**: Create comprehensive technical design addressing all requirements.

**Key Activities**:
- Research relevant technologies and approaches
- Design system architecture and component structure
- Define data models and interfaces
- Plan error handling and testing strategies
- Document design decisions and rationales

**Deliverable**: `design.md` with detailed technical design

**Quality Gate**: Explicit stakeholder approval required

## Phase 3: Tasks

**Objective**: Break down design into actionable implementation tasks.

**Key Activities**:
- Create discrete, manageable coding tasks
- Ensure requirement traceability for each task
- Sequence tasks for incremental development
- Focus on test-driven development approach
- Plan integration and validation steps

**Deliverable**: `tasks.md` with implementation checklist

**Quality Gate**: Explicit stakeholder approval required

## Core Principles

### 1. Systematic Progression
- Never skip phases or combine them inappropriately
- Each phase must be completed before proceeding
- Quality gates prevent premature advancement

### 2. Requirement Traceability
- Every design element traces back to requirements
- Every task references specific requirements
- Maintain clear audit trail throughout process

### 3. Stakeholder Involvement
- Regular feedback and approval checkpoints
- Explicit approval required at each phase
- Responsive to stakeholder input and changes

### 4. Incremental Development
- Tasks build incrementally on each other
- Early validation of core functionality
- Minimize risk through systematic approach

### 5. Quality Focus
- Built-in validation and review processes
- Emphasis on completeness and accuracy
- Continuous improvement of methodology

## Success Factors

- **Clear Communication**: Maintain open dialogue with stakeholders
- **Thorough Documentation**: Create comprehensive, accurate documents
- **Systematic Approach**: Follow the methodology consistently
- **Quality Focus**: Prioritize correctness over speed
- **Flexibility**: Adapt to feedback while maintaining structure

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Rushing through phases to save time
- Proceeding without explicit approval
- Skipping quality validation steps
- Poor requirement traceability
- Inadequate stakeholder involvement

This methodology provides a proven framework for transforming ideas into successful implementations while maintaining quality and stakeholder satisfaction.
