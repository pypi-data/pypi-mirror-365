The spec-driven development process follows three main phases:

## 1. Requirements Phase
- Define clear user stories
- Write acceptance criteria in EARS format
- Get explicit approval before proceeding

## 2. Design Phase
- Create comprehensive design document
- Address all requirements
- Include architecture and component details
- Get explicit approval before proceeding

## 3. Tasks Phase
- Break down design into actionable tasks
- Reference specific requirements
- Ensure tasks are implementable
- Get explicit approval before implementation

## Phase Transitions
- Each phase must be completed and approved
- Backward navigation is allowed for modifications
- Validation ensures quality at each step

EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) provides a structured way to write acceptance criteria.

## Basic Patterns

### WHEN...THEN...SHALL
Used for event-driven requirements:
- WHEN [event occurs] THEN [system] SHALL [response]

### IF...THEN...SHALL
Used for conditional requirements:
- IF [condition is true] THEN [system] SHALL [response]

### WHILE...THEN...SHALL
Used for continuous conditions:
- WHILE [condition persists] THEN [system] SHALL [response]

### WHERE...THEN...SHALL
Used for state-based requirements:
- WHERE [system is in state] THEN [system] SHALL [response]

## Examples

1. WHEN user clicks submit button THEN system SHALL validate form data
2. IF validation fails THEN system SHALL display error message
3. WHILE user is typing THEN system SHALL provide real-time feedback
4. WHERE user has admin privileges THEN system SHALL show admin menu

## Requirements to Design
- All requirements must be complete and approved
- User stories must be properly formatted
- Acceptance criteria must follow EARS format

## Design to Tasks
- Design document must include all required sections
- All requirements must be addressed in design
- Architecture and components must be clearly defined
- Explicit user approval required

## Tasks Completion
- All tasks must reference specific requirements
- Tasks must be actionable and implementable
- Dependencies must be properly ordered
- Explicit user approval required

## Backward Navigation
- Users can return to previous phases for modifications
- Changes may require re-approval of subsequent phases
