[Continue with additional tasks...]
```

## Task Writing Guidelines

### Task Structure
- Use numbered hierarchy (1, 2, 3... for main tasks)
- Use decimal notation for subtasks (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2...)
- Maximum two levels of hierarchy
- Each task should be a checkbox item `- [ ]`

### Task Content
- **Title**: Clear, action-oriented description
- **Details**: Specific implementation steps
- **Requirements Reference**: Link to specific requirements
- **Scope**: Focus on coding activities only

### Task Quality Criteria

#### Actionable Tasks
- Each task involves writing, modifying, or testing code
- Tasks are specific enough for immediate execution
- Implementation steps are concrete, not abstract
- Tasks can be completed by a developer independently

#### Requirement Traceability
- Every task references specific requirements (use granular references like 1.1, 2.3)
- All requirements are covered by at least one task
- No tasks exist without requirement justification
- Traceability is maintained throughout implementation

#### Incremental Development
- Tasks build logically on previous tasks
- No orphaned or disconnected code
- Core functionality is validated early
- Integration happens incrementally

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Non-Coding Tasks
❌ **Avoid These**:
- User acceptance testing
- Deployment to production
- Performance metrics gathering
- User training or documentation
- Business process changes

✅ **Focus on These Instead**:
- Writing automated tests
- Implementing code features
- Creating unit tests
- Building integration tests
- Writing validation code

### Vague Tasks
❌ **Too Abstract**:
- Implement user management
- Add security features
- Create responsive design

✅ **Specific and Actionable**:
- Implement UserService.createUser() method with email validation
- Add JWT token authentication middleware to API routes
- Create responsive CSS grid layout for dashboard component

### Poor Requirement Traceability
❌ **Vague References**:
- _Requirements: User management_
- _Requirements: Security_

✅ **Specific References**:
- _Requirements: 1.2, 2.1_
- _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3, 4.2_

## Validation Examples

### Good Task Examples
✅ **Clear and Actionable**
```markdown
- [ ] 2.1 Implement User model with validation
  - Create User class with email, password, and profile fields
  - Add email format validation using regex
  - Implement password strength requirements (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers)
  - Write unit tests for validation methods
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_
```

✅ **Proper Sequencing**
```markdown
- [ ] 3. Create authentication system
- [ ] 3.1 Implement password hashing utilities
  - Create PasswordHasher class using bcrypt
  - Add hash() and verify() methods
  - Write unit tests for password operations
  - _Requirements: 2.1_

- [ ] 3.2 Build authentication service
  - Create AuthService using PasswordHasher
  - Implement login() and register() methods
  - Add JWT token generation and validation
  - Write integration tests for auth flows
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3_
```

### Poor Task Examples
❌ **Too Abstract**
```markdown
- [ ] 1. Set up the system
  - Make it work properly
  - _Requirements: All_
```

❌ **Non-Coding Focus**
```markdown
- [ ] 2. Test the application with users
  - Get user feedback
  - Analyze usage patterns
  - _Requirements: 3.1_
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with Foundation**: Begin with core interfaces and data models
2. **Build Incrementally**: Each task should build on previous work
3. **Test Early and Often**: Include testing tasks throughout
4. **Be Specific**: Use concrete implementation details
5. **Maintain Traceability**: Always reference specific requirements
6. **Focus on Code**: Only include tasks that involve writing/modifying code
7. **Sequence Logically**: Ensure proper dependency order
8. **Keep Scope Manageable**: Break large tasks into smaller subtasks

This template ensures implementation plans are actionable, traceable, and lead to successful feature development.
