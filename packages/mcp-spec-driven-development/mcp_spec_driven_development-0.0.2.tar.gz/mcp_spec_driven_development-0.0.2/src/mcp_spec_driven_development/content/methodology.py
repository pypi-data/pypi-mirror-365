## Overview

Spec-driven development follows a systematic three-phase approach to transform feature ideas into implementation plans:

**Requirements → Design → Tasks**

Each phase builds upon the previous one and requires explicit approval before proceeding to the next phase.

## Phase 1: Requirements

**Purpose**: Transform rough feature ideas into structured, testable requirements using EARS format.

**Key Activities**:
- Write user stories in "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]" format
- Create acceptance criteria using EARS format (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)
- Ensure requirements are testable, specific, and complete
- Get explicit user approval before proceeding

**Output**: requirements.md file with structured requirements

## Phase 2: Design

**Purpose**: Create comprehensive technical design based on approved requirements.

**Key Activities**:
- Research relevant technologies and approaches
- Design system architecture and component interfaces
- Define data models and error handling strategies
- Plan testing approach
- Ensure design addresses all requirements
- Get explicit user approval before proceeding

**Output**: design.md file with detailed technical design

## Phase 3: Tasks

**Purpose**: Break down design into actionable implementation tasks.

**Key Activities**:
- Create discrete, manageable coding tasks
- Ensure each task references specific requirements
- Sequence tasks for incremental development
- Focus on test-driven development approach
- Get explicit user approval before implementation

**Output**: tasks.md file with implementation checklist

## Key Principles

1. **Systematic Progression**: Never skip phases or proceed without approval
2. **Requirement Traceability**: Every design element and task must trace back to requirements
3. **Incremental Development**: Tasks should build incrementally on each other
4. **Quality Gates**: Each phase includes validation and approval checkpoints
5. **User-Centered**: Regular user feedback and approval throughout the process"""

## Purpose

Transform rough feature ideas into structured, testable requirements that serve as the foundation for design and implementation.

## EARS Format (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)

Use these patterns for acceptance criteria:

- **WHEN** [trigger event] **THEN** [system] **SHALL** [response]
- **IF** [precondition] **THEN** [system] **SHALL** [response]
- **WHERE** [feature applies] **THEN** [system] **SHALL** [response]
- **WHILE** [system state] **THEN** [system] **SHALL** [response]

## User Story Format

**Template**: As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]

**Guidelines**:
- Role should be specific (user, admin, developer, etc.)
- Feature should be concrete and actionable
- Benefit should explain the value or motivation

## Requirements Structure

### Document Organization
1. **Introduction**: Brief feature overview and context
2. **Requirements**: Numbered list of user stories with acceptance criteria

### Quality Criteria
- Each requirement must be testable
- Acceptance criteria must be specific and measurable
- Requirements should cover normal flows, edge cases, and error conditions
- All stakeholder needs should be represented

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Vague Requirements**: Avoid subjective terms like "fast", "user-friendly"
2. **Missing Edge Cases**: Consider error conditions and boundary cases
3. **Implementation Details**: Focus on what, not how
4. **Incomplete Coverage**: Ensure all user needs are addressed

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] All user stories follow the standard format
- [ ] Acceptance criteria use EARS format
- [ ] Requirements are testable and specific
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions are covered
- [ ] Requirements are numbered and organized

## Purpose

Break down the approved design into discrete, actionable implementation tasks that can be executed systematically.

## Task Structure

### Format
```
- [ ] X. Task title
  - Implementation details
  - Specific requirements references
  - _Requirements: X.X, Y.Y_
```

### Hierarchy
- Use numbered tasks (1, 2, 3...)
- Use decimal notation for subtasks (1.1, 1.2, 2.1...)
- Maximum two levels of hierarchy
- Keep structure simple and clear

## Task Quality Criteria

### Actionable Tasks
- Each task must involve writing, modifying, or testing code
- Tasks should be specific enough for immediate execution
- Avoid high-level concepts; focus on concrete implementation

### Requirement Traceability
- Every task must reference specific requirements
- Use granular requirement references (1.1, 2.3) not just user stories
- Ensure all requirements are covered by tasks

### Incremental Development
- Tasks should build on previous tasks
- No orphaned or hanging code
- Early validation of core functionality
- Test-driven development approach

## Task Categories

### Setup Tasks
- Project structure and configuration
- Development environment setup
- Core interfaces and foundations

### Implementation Tasks
- Feature development in logical order
- Component implementation
- Integration and wiring

### Testing Tasks
- Unit test creation
- Integration test development
- Validation and quality assurance

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Non-Coding Tasks**: Avoid user testing, deployment, or business process tasks
2. **Too Abstract**: Tasks should be concrete implementation steps
3. **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure proper task sequencing
4. **Poor Traceability**: Every task must reference requirements

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Tasks reference specific requirements
- [ ] Implementation order is logical
- [ ] All requirements are covered

## What is EARS?

EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) is a structured format for writing clear, testable acceptance criteria.

## EARS Patterns

### 1. Event-Driven (WHEN...THEN)
**Pattern**: WHEN [trigger event] THEN [system] SHALL [response]

**Examples**:
- WHEN user clicks login button THEN system SHALL validate credentials
- WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN system SHALL display error message
- WHEN user session expires THEN system SHALL redirect to login page

### 2. Conditional (IF...THEN)
**Pattern**: IF [precondition] THEN [system] SHALL [response]

**Examples**:
- IF user is not authenticated THEN system SHALL deny access
- IF file size exceeds 10MB THEN system SHALL reject upload
- IF user has admin role THEN system SHALL show admin panel

### 3. State-Based (WHILE...THEN)
**Pattern**: WHILE [system state] THEN [system] SHALL [response]

**Examples**:
- WHILE backup is running THEN system SHALL display progress indicator
- WHILE user is typing THEN system SHALL show auto-suggestions
- WHILE data is loading THEN system SHALL show loading spinner

### 4. Feature-Specific (WHERE...THEN)
**Pattern**: WHERE [feature applies] THEN [system] SHALL [response]

**Examples**:
- WHERE user profile page THEN system SHALL display user information
- WHERE search results page THEN system SHALL highlight search terms
- WHERE mobile device THEN system SHALL use responsive layout

## Writing Guidelines

### Use Active Voice
- ✅ "system SHALL validate input"
- ❌ "input SHALL be validated"

### Be Specific
- ✅ "system SHALL display error message within 2 seconds"
- ❌ "system SHALL respond quickly"

### Use Measurable Criteria
- ✅ "system SHALL support up to 1000 concurrent users"
- ❌ "system SHALL handle many users"

### Include Error Conditions
- Normal flow: WHEN user submits valid form THEN system SHALL save data
- Error flow: WHEN user submits invalid form THEN system SHALL display validation errors

## Common Mistakes

1. **Vague Language**: Avoid subjective terms like "user-friendly", "fast", "intuitive"
2. **Implementation Details**: Focus on behavior, not how it's implemented
3. **Missing Conditions**: Specify when and where the requirement applies
4. **Untestable Criteria**: Ensure each criterion can be verified

## Validation Questions

For each EARS statement, ask:
- Is the trigger/condition clear and specific?
- Is the expected response measurable?
- Can this be tested automatically or manually?
- Are edge cases covered?"""

## Overview

Phase transitions are critical checkpoints that ensure quality and completeness before proceeding to the next phase.

## Transition Rules

### Requirements → Design
**Prerequisites**:
- Requirements document is complete
- All user stories follow proper format
- Acceptance criteria use EARS format
- Edge cases and error conditions are covered
- **Explicit user approval is obtained**

**Transition Process**:
1. Present completed requirements document
2. Ask: "Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design."
3. Wait for explicit approval ("yes", "approved", "looks good")
4. If feedback is provided, make revisions and ask for approval again
5. Only proceed after clear approval

### Design → Tasks
**Prerequisites**:
- Design document addresses all requirements
- Architecture is clearly documented
- Components and interfaces are defined
- Data models are complete
- Error handling and testing strategies are included
- **Explicit user approval is obtained**

**Transition Process**:
1. Present completed design document
2. Ask: "Does the design look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation plan."
3. Wait for explicit approval
4. If feedback is provided, make revisions and ask for approval again
5. Only proceed after clear approval

### Tasks → Implementation
**Prerequisites**:
- All tasks reference specific requirements
- Tasks are actionable and coding-focused
- Implementation order is logical
- All requirements are covered by tasks
- **Explicit user approval is obtained**

**Transition Process**:
1. Present completed tasks document
2. Ask: "Do the tasks look good?"
3. Wait for explicit approval
4. If feedback is provided, make revisions and ask for approval again
5. Implementation can begin after approval

## Approval Requirements

### What Counts as Approval
- ✅ "Yes", "Approved", "Looks good", "Perfect"
- ✅ "Ready to proceed", "Let's move on"
- ✅ "That works", "Sounds good"

### What Doesn't Count as Approval
- ❌ Questions or requests for clarification
- ❌ Suggestions for changes
- ❌ Silence or no response
- ❌ "Maybe", "I think so", "Probably"

## Backward Navigation

### When to Go Back
- User requests changes to previous phase
- Gaps discovered during current phase
- Requirements change or evolve
- Design doesn't fully address requirements

### Process
1. Acknowledge the need to revisit previous phase
2. Make necessary updates to the earlier document
3. Get approval for the updated document
4. Proceed forward through phases again

## Quality Gates

### Requirements Phase
- [ ] All user stories are complete
- [ ] EARS format is used correctly
- [ ] Edge cases are covered
- [ ] Requirements are testable
- [ ] User has explicitly approved

### Design Phase
- [ ] All requirements are addressed
- [ ] Architecture is documented
- [ ] Components are defined
- [ ] Testing strategy is included
- [ ] User has explicitly approved

### Tasks Phase
- [ ] All tasks are actionable
- [ ] Requirements are referenced
- [ ] Implementation order is logical
- [ ] All requirements are covered
- [ ] User has explicitly approved

## Common Transition Issues

1. **Proceeding Without Approval**: Never assume approval; always ask explicitly
2. **Ignoring Feedback**: Address all user feedback before asking for approval again
3. **Skipping Phases**: Each phase must be completed and approved
4. **Poor Documentation**: Ensure documents are complete before seeking approval"""

**Solution**:
- Use EARS format for all acceptance criteria
- Replace subjective terms with measurable criteria
- Add specific examples and edge cases
- Ask clarifying questions about user needs

#### Problem: Missing Edge Cases
**Symptoms**: Only happy path scenarios are covered
**Solution**:
- Systematically consider error conditions
- Think about boundary cases and limits
- Consider different user types and permissions
- Add validation and security requirements

#### Problem: Requirements Stall or Go in Circles
**Symptoms**: Endless revisions without progress
**Solution**:
- Focus on one aspect at a time
- Provide specific examples and options
- Summarize what's been established
- Suggest moving to different requirement areas

### Design Phase Issues

#### Problem: Design Doesn't Address All Requirements
**Symptoms**: Some requirements are not covered in design
**Solution**:
- Create traceability matrix
- Review each requirement systematically
- Add missing design elements
- Update architecture to accommodate all needs

#### Problem: Over-Engineering or Under-Engineering
**Symptoms**: Design is too complex or too simple
**Solution**:

- Ensure design addresses all stated needs
- Break complex designs into phases
- Validate design decisions against requirements

#### Problem: Insufficient Research
**Symptoms**: Technology choices are not justified
**Solution**:
- Research during design phase, not before
- Document key findings and decisions
- Include relevant links and references
- Justify choices based on requirements

### Tasks Phase Issues

#### Problem: Tasks Are Too Abstract
**Symptoms**: Tasks describe concepts rather than coding activities
**Solution**:
- Focus on specific implementation steps
- Break abstract tasks into concrete coding activities
- Specify files and components to create/modify
- Ensure tasks are immediately actionable

#### Problem: Poor Requirement Traceability
**Symptoms**: Tasks don't reference specific requirements
**Solution**:
- Add requirement references to each task
- Use granular references (1.1, 2.3) not just user stories
- Ensure all requirements are covered
- Create traceability matrix if needed

#### Problem: Illogical Task Sequence
**Symptoms**: Tasks have dependency issues or poor ordering
**Solution**:
- Start with foundational components
- Ensure each task builds on previous ones
- Plan for early testing and validation
- Avoid orphaned or disconnected code

### Workflow Issues

#### Problem: User Won't Approve Documents
**Symptoms**: User keeps requesting changes or seems unsatisfied
**Solution**:
- Ask specific questions about concerns
- Provide options when user is unsure
- Break down complex decisions
- Offer to return to previous phases if needed

#### Problem: Skipping Phases or Rushing
**Symptoms**: Pressure to move quickly through phases
**Solution**:
- Explain importance of systematic approach
- Show how skipping phases leads to problems later
- Focus on quality over speed
- Demonstrate value of each phase

#### Problem: Scope Creep During Development
**Symptoms**: New requirements emerge during design or tasks
**Solution**:
- Document new requirements properly
- Return to requirements phase if needed
- Get approval for scope changes
- Update design and tasks accordingly

## Recovery Strategies

### When Requirements Need Major Changes
1. Acknowledge the need for changes
2. Update requirements document completely
3. Get explicit approval for updated requirements
4. Update design to reflect new requirements
5. Revise tasks based on updated design

### When Design Has Fundamental Issues
1. Identify specific problems with current design
2. Conduct additional research if needed
3. Create revised design addressing issues
4. Ensure all requirements are still covered
5. Get approval before proceeding to tasks

### When Tasks Are Unworkable
1. Analyze why tasks are problematic
2. Return to design phase if architectural changes needed
3. Break down complex tasks into smaller ones
4. Improve requirement traceability
5. Resequence tasks for better flow

## Prevention Strategies

### Requirements Phase
- Use structured templates and formats
- Ask probing questions about edge cases
- Provide examples to clarify concepts
- Validate understanding with user

### Design Phase
- Research thoroughly during design
- Document all design decisions
- Create clear architecture diagrams
- Ensure comprehensive coverage

### Tasks Phase
- Focus on coding activities only
- Maintain clear requirement traceability
- Plan incremental development approach
- Validate task sequence and dependencies

## When to Seek Help

- User feedback is consistently negative
- Requirements seem impossible to satisfy
- Technical constraints conflict with requirements
- Workflow is stuck in endless loops
- Quality standards cannot be met

Remember: It's better to take time to get it right than to rush through and create problems later."""
