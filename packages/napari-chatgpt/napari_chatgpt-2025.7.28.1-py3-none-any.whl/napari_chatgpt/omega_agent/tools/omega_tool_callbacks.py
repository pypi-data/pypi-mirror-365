        _on_tool_activity: Callable
            A callback function to be called when a tool is active.
            It should accept the tool instance, the type of activity, and any additional keyword arguments.
        _on_tool_end: Callable
            A callback function to be called when a tool ends.
            It should accept the tool instance and the result of the tool execution.
        _on_tool_error: Callable
            A callback function to be called when a tool encounters an error.
            It should accept the tool instance and the exception that occurred.
