    Classic cell segmentation function.

    Parameters
    ----------

    image: ArrayLike
            Image for which to segment cells. Can be 2D or 3D.

    threshold_type: str
            Algorithm to use for thresholding. Options include: 'otsu', 'yen', 'li', 'minimum', 'triangle', 'mean', 'isodata'.

    normalize: Optional[bool]
            If True, normalizes the image to a given percentile range.
            If False, assumes that the image is already normalized to [0,1].

    norm_range_low: Optional[float]
            Lower percentile for normalization

    norm_range_high: Optional[float]
            Higher percentile for normalization

    min_segment_size: Optional[int]
            Minimum number of pixels in a segment. Segments smaller than this are removed.

    erosion_steps: Optional[int]
            Number of iterations of the erosion operator to apply to the image.

    closing_steps: Optional[int]
            Number of iterations of the closing operator to apply to the thresholded image.

    opening_steps: Optional[int]
            Number of iterations of the opening operator to apply to the thresholded image.

    apply_watershed: Optional[bool]
            If True, applies the watershed algorithm to the distance transform of the thresholded image.

    min_distance: Optional[int]
            Minimum number of pixels separating peaks in a region of `2 * min_distance + 1`

    Returns
    -------
    Segmented image as a labels array that can be added to napari as a Labels layer.
