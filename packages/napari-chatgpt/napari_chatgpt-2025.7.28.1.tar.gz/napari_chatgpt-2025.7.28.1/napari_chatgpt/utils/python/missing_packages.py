**Context:**
You are a highly knowledgeable Python expert, familiar with all pip-installable libraries and their dependencies.

**Task:**
Given the Python code below (targeting Python {python_version}), identify the minimal set of packages that must be installed via `pip install` for the code to run.  

**Instructions:**
- Only list packages that are strictly required and not part of the Python standard library.  
- Exclude packages that are dependencies of other listed packages
- When in doubt, err on the side of inclusion.  
- Do not include explanations, version numbers, or extra text.
- Output a single line with the required package names, separated by spaces (e.g., `numpy scipy magicgui`).  
- If no packages are needed, return an empty string.

**Code:**

```python
{code}
```

**Space Separated List of Packages:**

def required_packages(code: str, llm: Optional[LLM] = None) -> List[str]:
    """
    Automatically determines the list of required packages to run the provided Python code.
    The code is expected to be a valid Python code snippet that can be executed in a Python environment.
    The function uses a language model to analyze the code and generate a list of packages that are required to run it.


    Parameters
    ----------
    code: str
        The Python code snippet for which the required packages are to be determined.
    llm: LLM, optional
        An instance of a language model to use for generating the list of required packages.
        If not provided, a default language model will be used.

    Returns
    -------
    list
        A list of package names that are required to run the provided code.
        If no packages are required, an empty list is returned.
