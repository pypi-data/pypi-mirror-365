# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Deprecated features that will be removed in the next major version (15.X.X).

- `sporestack server launch` will not default to `--provider digitalocean`. You will have to pass a provider.
- `sporestack server launch` will not default to `--flavor vps-1vcpu-1gb`. You will have to pass a flavor.
- `sporestack server launch` will require setting `--flavor`. `--flavor auto` will be possible with `--provider digitalocean`.

## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet.

## [14.3.0 - 2025-03-29]

### CLI

#### Added

- List features and type (vps or baremetal) in `sporestack server flavors`.

### Library

#### Added

- Added architecture, features, and type to models.flavor.

## [14.2.0 - 2025-02-10]

### Added

- Can pass `--region auto` to `sporestack server launch`, for `--provider digitalocean`.
- New command: `sporestack aup`

## [14.1.0 - 2025-02-09]

### Changed

- Removed end-of-lifed Python 3.8 support.
- Slightly improved `sporestack token messages` output.

### Added

- `messages` to `sporestack token info`
- `invoices` to `sporestack token info`

## [14.0.2 - 2025-01-31]

### Fixed

- Fix compatibility with Vultr's IPv6-only flavor. Still some things to improve on this.

## [14.0.1 - 2025-01-22]

### Fixed

- Fix compatibility with `httpx` version 0.28.X.

## [14.0.0 - 2024-11-11]

Changed from `/servers/{machine_id}` to `/token/{token}/servers/{machine_id}`. This had cascading changes requiring a token wherever there was just a `machine_id`, previously.

For instance, `client.Server` requires a token now. `api_client` had the most changes but is usually not recommended for direct consumption.

### Removed

- `sporestack token servers` removed in favor  of `sporestack server list`.

## [13.2.0 - 2024-07-17]

`--hostname` usage should be faster if you have a lot of servers on your token.

### Added

- Support for filtering by `hostname`, `include_deleted`, and `include_forgotten` with `api_client.servers_launched_from_token()`.
- `sporestack server list` now has `--show-deleted/--no-show-deleted`. Defaults to `--show-deleted`.

## [13.1.0 - 2024-07-08]

### Added

- Support for specifying a provider with slugs calls (`flavors()`, `operating_systems()`, and `regions()`).

## [13.0.0 - 2024-06-25]

### Notable

This release adds support for launching servers on Vultr. This is very beta! (More on the backend side of things.)

 1. You'll need to pick a suitable flavor with: `sporestack server flavors --provider vultr`
 2. You'll need to pick a suitable region with: `sporestack server region --provider vultr`
 3. You'll need to pick a suitable OS with: `sporestack server operatingsystems --provider vultr`
 4. Launch the server accordingly: `sporestack server launch --provider vultr --region (your region) --flavor (your flavor) --operating-system (your OS)`

### Added

- Vultr support!
- `flavor`, `operating_system`, and `region` properties to `client.Server()`, returning those objects.

### Breaking Changes (Library)

- `client.Client.regions()` and `api_client.APIClient.regions()` now return `list[Region]`.
- `client.Client.operating_systems()` and `api_client.APIClient.operating_systems()` now return `list[OperatingSystem]`.
- `client.Client.flavors()` and `api_client.APIClient.flavors()` now return `list[Flavor]`.
- `ServerIfnoResponse` lost the `flavor` attribute. (Refer to `flavor_slug`)

### Changed

## [12.1.1 - 2024-06-21]

### Added

- Return provider in server info display.

## [12.1.0 - 2024-06-19]

### Added

- Preliminary provider support, to specify an alternative provider other than DigitalOcean. This isn't yet implemented on the backend, but it's on the radar!

## [12.0.0 - 2024-06-19]

### Added

- Support for Cloud Init user data in the library and CLI. You can use `sporestack server launch --user-data-file ./path/to/cloud.init.user.data`
- `sporestack.exceptions.SporeStackPaymentRequiredError`

### Removed

- Specifying a token when topping up a server. The server you used to launch the token should be used for topping it up, which is the default.
- `random_machine_id()` was removed from `sporestack.utils` as it's no longer needed.
- `--local` was removed from `sporestack server list`.

### Breaking Changes (Library)

- Three enums, `Currency`, `ServerDeletedBy`, and `TokenMessageSender` were moved from `sporestack.models` to `sporestack.constants`.
- `sporestack.api_client` has changes reflecting the recent API change from `POST /server/{machine_id}/launch` to `POST /token/{token}/servers`.
- `machine_id` was removed from `server_launch()` calls.
- `sporestack.client.Server` no longer accepts a `token` argument.

### Other Changes (Library)

- `days` is no longer required. You can set `autorenew=True` or `days=int`. If `autorenew=True`, `days` should be set to `None` or ignored. You can't have `autorenew=False` and `days=None`, however.
- `~/.sporestack/servers` is no longer used and can be removed. If it does have files, however, you should back it up first just in case.

## [11.1.0 - 2024-03-16]

## Added

### Library

- `ssh_key` to `client.Client()` and to `client.Token()`. This acts as a default SSH key when launching servers this way.

### CLI

- Support for automatic per-token SSH keys (can be overridden with `--ssh-key-file` still.) To generate, run: `ssh-keygen -C "" -t ed25519 -f ~/.sporestack/sshkey/{token}/id_ed25519`
- This means that you don't have to pass `--ssh-key-file` if you are using a token that has a locally associated SSH key.
- When launching a server with `sporestack server launch`, it will suggest adding a readymade configuration to `~/.ssh/config` to utilize whatever key you selected.

## Summary

These changes should make it easier to stay private with SporeStack, conveniently, by utilizing a SSH key per token. In general, we recommend using one unique SSH key per token that you have.

## [11.0.1 - 2024-02-29]

## Fixed

- If a server is deleted during the launch wait phase, it will give up rather than trying to wait forever for an IP address that will never come.

## [11.0.0 - 2024-02-26]

## Changed

- Various command/help cleanups.
- If you want the CLI features, you will have to `pip install sporestack[cli]` instead of just `pip install sporestack`.
- `--no-local` is now the default for `sporestack server list`.

## Removed
