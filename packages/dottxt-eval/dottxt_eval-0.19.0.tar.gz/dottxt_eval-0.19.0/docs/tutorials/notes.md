# Comprehensive Analysis of doteval Documentation Against Diataxis Framework

## Executive Summary

After conducting a thorough analysis of the doteval documentation structure against the Diataxis framework, I find that the documentation is **generally well-structured** but has several areas for improvement to better align with Diataxis principles. The current structure shows understanding of the framework but contains content misplacements and gaps that could confuse users seeking specific types of information.

## Current Structure Assessment

### Overall Organization
The documentation is organized into four main sections that roughly correspond to Diataxis quadrants:
- **Getting Started** (Mixed: Tutorial + Explanation elements)
- **Tutorials** (Learning-oriented content)
- **Explanation** (Understanding-oriented content)
- **Reference** (Information-oriented content)

**Missing**: A dedicated **How-to Guides** section (Problem-oriented content)

## Detailed Analysis by Section

### 1. Getting Started Section

**Current Status**: MIXED - Contains both Tutorial and Explanation content
**Files**: `index.md`, `welcome.md`, `why-llm-evaluation.md`, `installation.md`, `quickstart.md`

#### Content Classification Issues:

**`welcome.md`**:
- **Should be**: Tutorial (learning-oriented)
- **Currently**: Mixed Tutorial + Reference
- **Issues**: Contains both step-by-step guidance AND comprehensive feature overview. The detailed examples and complete pipeline section are more tutorial-appropriate, but the "Core Concepts" section reads like explanation material.

**`why-llm-evaluation.md`**:
- **Should be**: Explanation (understanding-oriented)
- **Currently**: Properly placed explanation content
- **Assessment**: ✅ Well-aligned - focuses on WHY evaluation matters

**`installation.md`**:
- **Should be**: How-to Guide (problem-oriented)
- **Currently**: Mixed How-to + Tutorial
- **Issues**: The verification steps are tutorial-like (safe to fail, learning), but the core installation instructions are problem-solving oriented

**`quickstart.md`**:
- **Should be**: Tutorial (learning-oriented)
- **Currently**: ✅ Properly aligned tutorial content
- **Assessment**: Good step-by-step progression, safe to fail environment

### 2. Tutorials Section

**Current Status**: WELL-STRUCTURED - Properly learning-oriented
**Files**: 9 numbered tutorials from `01-your-first-evaluation.md` to `09-build-production-evaluation-pipeline.md`

#### Content Quality Assessment:

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Sequential progression (numbered 01-09)
- ✅ Step-by-step instructions
- ✅ Safe-to-fail examples with working code
- ✅ Clear learning objectives per tutorial
- ✅ Hands-on, practical approach

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Some tutorials blend in reference material (e.g., Tutorial 2 has extensive API reference content)
- Could benefit from more consistent "What you'll learn" and "What you'll build" sections
- Tutorial 4 introduces complex concepts that might be better in explanation section first

**Specific Issues**:

**Tutorial 2 (`02-using-real-models.md`)**:
- Contains extensive error handling patterns that are more reference-like
- The monitoring and metrics sections read more like how-to guides

**Tutorial 6 (`06-pytest-fixtures-and-resource-pooling.md`)**:
- Should be examined to ensure it's learning-focused rather than problem-solving focused

### 3. Explanation Section

**Current Status**: GOOD STRUCTURE but UNDERDEVELOPED
**Files**: `index.md`, `design-principles.md`, `control-plane-architecture.md`, plus core-concepts subdirectory

#### Content Quality Assessment:

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Proper focus on understanding WHY things work as they do
- ✅ `design-principles.md` is excellent explanation content
- ✅ Good theoretical foundation

**Major Gaps**:
- Missing evaluation theory and best practices
- No discussion of when to use different evaluation approaches
- Limited coverage of LLM evaluation concepts
- The "Evaluation Theory" section shows as "Coming soon"

**Content Issues**:
- `control-plane-architecture.md` might be too implementation-focused for explanation
- Core concepts might overlap with reference material

### 4. Reference Section

**Current Status**: EXCELLENT - Well-structured information-oriented content
**Files**: Multiple `.md` files covering all major components

#### Content Quality Assessment:

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage of all features
- ✅ Proper information-oriented approach (dry, factual)
- ✅ Good use of code examples for API illustration
- ✅ Well-organized by component

**Minor Issues**:
- Some files contain tutorial-like explanations that might be better moved
- `foreach.md` is very comprehensive - might need splitting

## Missing Quadrant: How-to Guides

**CRITICAL GAP**: No dedicated How-to Guides section

**What's Missing**:
- Problem-solving oriented content
- Goal-oriented instructions for specific use cases
- Recipes for common scenarios

**Examples of needed How-to Guides**:
- "How to evaluate model performance on custom metrics"
- "How to set up continuous evaluation in CI/CD"
- "How to handle API rate limits effectively"
- "How to compare models cost-effectively"
- "How to debug failing evaluations"
- "How to scale evaluations for production"

**Current Workarounds**:
Some tutorial content serves as implicit how-to guides (e.g., Tutorial 8 on rate limits), but these are mixed with learning-oriented content.

## Content Misplacements

### High Priority Fixes:

1. **`installation.md`** → Move to How-to Guides
   - The installation steps are problem-solving oriented
   - Keep verification in tutorials or create separate "Getting Started" tutorial

2. **Tutorial 2 error handling sections** → Move to How-to Guides
   - "How to handle API failures in evaluations"
   - "How to monitor evaluation costs and performance"

3. **Tutorial 8 rate limiting** → Move to How-to Guides
   - "How to manage API rate limits in production"

### Medium Priority Fixes:

1. **`welcome.md` Core Concepts section** → Move to Explanation
2. **Reference sections with tutorial-like content** → Extract to appropriate tutorials
3. **Complex concepts in tutorials** → Ensure explanation coverage first

## Specific Content Quality Issues

### Learning-oriented (Tutorials)
**Current State**: Good
**Issues**:
- Some tutorials assume too much prior knowledge
- Inconsistent "What you'll learn" framing
- Error handling mixed with learning objectives

### Problem-oriented (How-to)
**Current State**: Missing section entirely
**Issues**:
- Problem-solving content scattered across tutorials
- No dedicated space for goal-oriented recipes
- Users seeking solutions must dig through learning material

### Understanding-oriented (Explanation)
**Current State**: Underdeveloped
**Issues**:
- Missing crucial evaluation theory
- No guidance on when to use different approaches
- Limited coverage of LLM-specific evaluation concepts

### Information-oriented (Reference)
**Current State**: Excellent
**Issues**:
- Minor mixing of tutorial-like explanations
- Could benefit from more concise API listings

## Improvement Recommendations

### 1. Create How-to Guides Section

**Immediate Actions**:
- Create `/docs/how-to/` directory

- **Reference**: 9/10 (maintain current quality)

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (High Impact, Low Effort):
1. Create How-to Guides section structure
2. Move `installation.md` to how-to guides
3. Extract problem-solving content from Tutorial 2 and 8

### Phase 2 (Medium Impact, Medium Effort):
1. Enhance Explanation section with missing theory
2. Clean up tutorial focus and consistency
3. Update navigation structure

### Phase 3 (High Impact, High Effort):
1. Create comprehensive how-to guide library
2. Review and refine all content against Diataxis principles
3. User testing and feedback incorporation

## Conclusion

The doteval documentation shows a solid understanding of documentation structure but suffers from the common issue of missing the "How-to Guides" quadrant and some content misplacement. The Reference section is exemplary, Tutorials are generally well-done but need focus cleanup, Explanation needs development, and How-to Guides are entirely missing.

With the recommended changes, the documentation would provide a much clearer path for users seeking different types of information and better align with Diataxis principles for maximum effectiveness.

## Current Task: Clean up @foreach decorator reference

**Analysis:**
The current `/Users/remilouf/projects/doteval/docs/reference/foreach.md` contains extensive pytest-specific content that should be removed to keep the reference focused on the decorator itself.

**Sections to remove:**
1. "Integration with pytest" section (lines 250-300)
2. pytest-specific examples in "Execution Modes" section
3. pytest command-line examples throughout
4. pytest fixture integration details
5. pytest test execution details

**Content to keep:**
- Decorator API and parameters
- Function signatures and behavior
- Basic usage patterns
- Return values and error handling
- Column specification details
- Dataset format support
- Advanced configuration options
- Error handling patterns

**Plan:**
1. ✅ Remove the entire "Integration with pytest" section
2. ✅ Clean up "Execution Modes" section to focus on programmatic execution
3. ✅ Remove pytest command-line examples
4. ✅ Keep fixture examples but make them generic (not pytest-specific)
5. ✅ Update "See Also" section to point to pytest reference for integration details

**Completed Changes:**
- Removed the entire "Integration with pytest" section (lines 250-300)
- Removed the "Direct Function Call" subsection as requested
- Updated "Function Arguments" section to use generic dependencies instead of pytest fixtures
- Cleaned up "Execution Modes" to focus on test framework integration and programmatic execution
- Removed all pytest command-line examples from Performance Optimization section
- Updated "See Also" section to clarify that pytest integration details belong in the pytest reference
- Updated function signature documentation to be generic about testing framework integration
- Made all examples focus on the decorator API rather than pytest-specific usage

**Result:**
The `foreach.md` reference is now focused purely on the decorator itself - its API, parameters, function signatures, basic usage patterns, return values, and error handling. All pytest-specific content has been moved conceptually to the pytest reference documentation.
