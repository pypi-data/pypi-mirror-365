# pyfastmath

🚀 **pyfastmath** is a blazing-fast math utility module for Python, written in C for maximum performance.
It includes essential number-theoretic functions like GCD, primality checking, and modular exponentiation.

## ✨ Features

* 🟰 `gcd(a, b)` – Compute the Greatest Common Divisor of two integers
* 🔍 `is_prime(n)` – Efficiently check if a number is prime
* 🔐 `mod_exp(base, exp, mod)` – Perform Modular Exponentiation: (base^exp) % mod
