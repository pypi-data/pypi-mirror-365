## 🛠 Installation

Install using pip: open a command window and type

```
pip install docu-lite
```
## 💡 Usage
Either edit and run docu-lite.py in an IDE, or run from the command line:
```
docu-lite                         # uses or creates docu-lite.ini
docu-lite --config alt.ini        # uses alt.ini, errors if missing
```
Docu-lite will create a docu-lite.ini file if one doesn't exist.

⚙️ Edit the docu-lite.ini file to control how docu-lite runs:
 - **pattern** specifies where to look for input
 - **html** specifies the name of the output html file
 - **css** specifies the name of the input style sheet, which will be referenced from the output html file
 - **documentation_mode** produces a less detailed output styled for use as or editing into documentation. 
     - ignores code blocks starting with _ (e.g. def _name)
     - hides 'self' in function argument lists
     - provides inner content only for docstrings, not code
     - style sheet dedicated to this mode can be specified in the ini file
 - **ignore_docstrings_with** can be followed by = word to ignore docstrings containing the word (e.g. License, useful to stop license blocks appearing in the output)  


📝 If the specified css file is not found, docu-lite will generate one and reference it in the html

## ⚠️ Known Issues
 - Doesn't cleanly handle all variations of docstring layout. In particular, the single line docstring causes the body below the docstring to appear below it.
 - Doesn't cleanly handle function definitions that span several lines (only first line is shown)
